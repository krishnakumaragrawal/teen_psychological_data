We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.

We've created a wiki that covers these issues. We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report. It explains in detail why any validation of suicidal intent, even an "innocent" message like "if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at .

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the "report" button or by with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both and to us in modmail.

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.

We're here to offer support, not judgement. That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express. Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring. The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.

But there's an important line to draw here. There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, encourages suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions.

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.

In the most useful empirical model we have , the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world.

So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something "innocent" like "I hope you find peace", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.
• People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions. Unfortunately, many popular "good" responses are actually counterproductive . In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that "it's not so bad", and this is usually experienced as "I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try". People who've had "help" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same. It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.
• Most people who are suicidal want to end their pain, not their lives. It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding.
• An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible. We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed. For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it. We go into more depth on the "it gets better" issue in which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines.
• There are always more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead. Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world. offer more detailed guidance.

Look Out for Deliberate Incitement. It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ( unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon ). People like this are out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.

They will typically try to scratch their psychological "itch" by saying things that push people closer to the edge. They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above. Specifically you might see people doing the following:
• Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying. There are always more and better choices than "brutally forcing someone to stay alive" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives.
• Creating an artificial and toxic sense of "solidarity" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy. They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses. Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help. A couple of key points to keep in mind:
• Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment. Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does not involve persuasion ("Don't do it!"), cheerleading ("You've got this!") or meaningless false promises ("Trust me, it gets better!"), or invalidation ("Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"). Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)
• Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible. Any kind of involuntary intervention is an extremely unlikely outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in ). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect. Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

Please let us know discreetly if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.



Conclusion: Patients with intentional APP have high suicidal intent. Therefore, different interventions should be tailored to different patients.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled a total of 225 patients with intentional APP admitted to the emergency department of our Grade A comprehensive hospital in Shandong Province between June 2019 and January 2021. Patients were investigated using a health status interview questionnaire, Beck Suicidal Intent Scale, Duke Social Support Index, psychological stress scale, Dickman Impulsivity Inventory, Trait Anxiety Inventory, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and Beck Hopelessness Scale. Descriptive statistics, single-factor analysis, and multiple linear regression were used for data analysis.

Introduction: Since pesticides have been widely used in agricultural production, acute pesticide poisoning (APP) has gradually become a worldwide public health problem. Recently, the number of APP cases has been high in China, and the intentional self-administration of pesticides is the main cause of APP. However, there is a lack of relevant studies on the factors influencing suicidal intent in patients with intentional APP. This study aimed to explore the current situation and influencing factors for suicidal intent among patients with intentional APP.

Since pesticides have been widely used in agricultural production, acute pesticide poisoning (APP) has gradually become a worldwide public health problem (1). Recently, the number of APP cases has been high in China, and the intentional self-administration of pesticides is the main cause of APP (1). In rural developing countries, intentional APP is the preferred method of intentional suicide (2).

In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that intentional APP accounts for one-third of suicides worldwide (2). The 2019 edition of the WHO's guidelines on pesticide hazard classification emphasized that banning the use of high-risk pesticides could prevent the deaths of more than 155,000 patients with intentional APP (3). Due to APP's characteristics (which presents as a severe and rapidly changing disease), the mortality rate following APP is high, particularly in developing countries (4). For example, the mortality rate of patients with intentional APP in China is ~6.85% (5). Moreover, intentional APP has imposed a huge economic burden on many individuals and families, resulting in poverty for many rural families and severely affecting the social stability of rural areas (6).

Suicidal intent refers to a person's intent to end their life through suicide. Suicide attempters with high suicidal intent scores have a stronger intention to die than those with low intent scores and may have a higher risk of completing suicide (7).

Many factors, such as age, gender, history of suicide attempts, social support, negative life events, anxiety, depression, impulsivity, and psychological strain, among others, influence suicide intention (8–12). Studies on suicidal intent in Western countries mostly focus on patients with mental disorders, which may be because >90% of suicides in these countries are associated with mental illness (8, 13). We note that there are numerous studies on gender differences among patients with suicidal intent and the relationship between despair, depression, impulsivity, and suicidal intent (9–11). However, only ~30–63% of suicides in China are related to mental illness (14), and there is a lack of relevant studies on the factors influencing suicidal intent in patients with intentional APP.

Therefore, our study (building on previous work on suicidal intent) aimed to describe the suicidal intent of patients with intentional APP within 1 week of hospital admission and comprehensively discuss the influencing factors.

Convenience sampling was used to select patients with intentional APP admitted to the emergency department of our Grade A comprehensive hospital in Shandong Province between June 2019 and January 2021. We enrolled patients based on our study inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The study inclusion criteria were as follows: patients with intentional APP (with a clear diagnosis and clear awareness; family members or patients were surveyed regarding medical history and other information); within 1 week of admission; stable vital signs and ability to complete the questionnaire independently or with the help of the researchers; and the provision of informed consent and voluntary participation in this study. Those with language barriers or communication difficulties and those in serious condition were excluded from this study.

Overall, 225 of the eligible participants met the inclusion criteria, and 207 valid questionnaires were completed, with an effective rate of 92.0%.

To collect general demographic characteristics, we administered the “Health Condition Interview Questionnaire,” which was constructed by our research group. The main evaluated factors included age, gender, residential area, occupation, marital status, religious belief, mental illness before the suicide attempt, suicide attempt history, family history of suicide, untreated physical disease before the suicide attempt, economic level, family status, and negative life events. The relevance of clinical data to suicidal intent is shown in the Supplementary material.

Suicidal intent was measured using the Beck Suicidal Intent Scale (SIS), which is currently popularly administered worldwide (15). There are 15 items on the scale, among which items 1–8 are related to the objective environment comprising the context of the patient's suicidal behavior, and items 9–15 are related to the expectations and perceptions of the suicidal person. Each question is scored on a scale of 0–2. The higher the score, the higher the patient's suicidal intent (that is, the stronger the desire to die). This scale has been widely used in the Chinese population and has demonstrated good validity and reliability (16).

The Duke Social Support Index (DSSI), developed at Duke University, was also used for evaluation in this study (17). The DSSI comprises the following three subscales: the Social Interaction Subscale (SIS, four items), the Subjective Support Subscale (SSS, seven items), and the Instrumental Social Support Subscale (ISS, 12 items). The SIS and SSS represent Level 3 scores, while the ISS represents Level 2 scores. The sum of the scores of each subscale item represents the score for social support in this dimension, and the total social support score represents the sum of the scores of the three subscales. A higher score indicates a higher level of social support. The Chinese version of DSSI has previously demonstrated high validity and reliability in suicidal individuals (18).

Zhang (12) developed a mental strain scale to measure mental strain in questionnaire respondents. This scale includes 40 items and four measurement dimensions, each containing 10 items. The questions are scored on a scale of 1–5, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The higher the score, the more mental strain on a participant. This scale demonstrates good validity and reliability (19).

The Dickman Impulsivity Inventory (DII) was used to measure personality traits on impulsivity in this study. Dickman categorizes impulses into functional impulsivity (FI) and dysfunctional impulsivity (DI). There are a total of 31 items in the DII. Only the first 23 items were used in this study, with the DI subscale comprising 12 items and the FI subscale comprising 11 items. Each item is graded on a scale of 0–1, with an overall score of 0–23. The higher the scale score, the higher the individual's level of impulsivity. The Chinese version of the DII has demonstrated good validity and reliability in the Chinese population (20).

The Trait Anxiety Inventory used in this study was derived from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (21). More specifically, the first 20 items are taken from the State Anxiety Inventory, and the last 20 items represent an anxiety trait subscale. The questions are scored on a four-point scale, with an overall maximum score ranging from 20 to 80. The higher the score, the more anxious the individual. A score of <50 is considered normal, a score of 51–60 represents mild anxiety, a score of 61–70 signifies moderate anxiety, and a score of >70 represents severe anxiety. Previous studies have demonstrated that the Chinese version of the STAI is a useful tool for measuring anxiety (22).

The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used in this study to evaluate the frequency of depressive symptoms occurring in the past week (23). The scale cannot be used to diagnose clinical depression. Instead, the scale can only be used to evaluate the severity of depressive symptomology. This scale is suitable for use in general population studies. This instrument is scored on a scale of 0–60, and the higher the score, the greater the severity of depressive symptoms. A score of <10 indicates no depression symptomology, a score of 10–20 indicates possible depression, and a score of >20 represents definite depression. The Chinese version of the CES-D has demonstrated good reliability and validity among the Chinese population (24).

The Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) is used to quantify the degree of an individual's negative attitudes toward the future (25). The self-rating scale includes the following three dimensions: feelings about the future, loss of motivation, and expectations about the future. The BHS includes 20 items, and the original scale includes the following two answer options: “true” or “false.” To better reflect interindividual differences, this study extended the score to the following five levels: 1 = complete agreement; 2 = basically consistent; 3 = uncertain; 4 = more or less the opposite; 5 = exactly the opposite. Items 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, and 19 are reverse entries. This instrument is scored on a scale of 20–100; the higher the score, the greater the sense of hopelessness. The Chinese version of the BHS has demonstrated good validity and reliability in previous studies of those attempting suicide (26).

SPSS statistical software (v.22.0, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for data entry and statistical analysis. For measurement data, if the data followed a normal or nearly normal distribution and had uniform variance, we generated descriptive data presented as mean ± standard deviation. In addition, t-tests were used for comparing means between two groups, and analysis of variance was used for comparing means between more than two groups. Medians and quartile spacing were used for statistical description if the data showed a non-normal or skewed distribution or uneven variances.

Non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum and Kruskal–Wallis H-tests were used for generating statistical inferences. The classification variables were described statistically as frequencies and percentages. Furthermore, correlation analysis was used to evaluate the correlations between variables. Pearson correlation analysis was used for bivariate, normally distributed data. Spearman rank correlation was used for the statistical analysis of non-normally distributed data. Continuous normally distributed data and multiple linear regression were used for regression analysis. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

General demographic information and a single-factor analysis for the 207 patients with intentional APP included in this study are presented in Table 1. The results of the univariate analysis showed that age, residential area, marital status, occupation, history of attempted suicide, mental illness before intentional APP, economic status, and family status had statistically significant effects on the instrument-derived scores of the patients with intentional APP (P < 0.05).

The average suicidal intent score for patients with intentional APP was 14.23 ± 6.22. In the objective portion of the study, the average score for the help-seeking behavior item was the highest (1.55 ± 0.77); 72.0% of the patients with intentional APP did not contact or inform those who might help them before acting. In the subjective portion of the study, the score for patients' attitudes toward the suicide attempt was the highest (1.50 ± 0.68); 60.4% of the patients with intentional APP were serious about ending their own lives, as presented in Tables 2, 3.

We found a positive correlation between suicidal intent and psychological strain, hopelessness, anxiety, and depression in patients with intentional APP. The suicidal intent of patients with intentional APP was negatively correlated with impulsivity and social support, as presented in Table 4.

Multiple linear regression was conducted, with the suicidal intent of patients with intentional APP defined as the dependent variable and variables showing statistically significant differences on single-factor analysis (from among general sociodemographic, sociological, and psychological factors) defined as the independent variables.

A stepwise independent variable screening method was also conducted. The criterion for variable elimination was a P-value corresponding to an F value. The statistical significance levels of the entry and elimination variables were P ≤ 0.10 and P ≥ 0.15, respectively. Marital status, region of residence, impulsivity, hopelessness, depression, psychological strain, and social support were entered into the regression equation, with the following values assigned to the marital status and residential area variables: married and “other” = 1, never married = 0; rural = 1, urban = 0). The regression model was statistically significant F = 11.505 (P < 0.001; Table 5).

In our study, the average score for suicidal intent in patients with intentional APP was considerably higher than the scores for suicidal intent in individuals who made serious suicide attempts in rural China, as documented in previous studies (27). The total average score for suicidal intent in patients with intentional APP was also lower than the score for suicidal intent reported in a previous study by Tong et al. but was higher than the score for suicidal intent in patients who attempted suicide in that study (28). In the same study, more than half of those attempting suicide took pesticides; however, the intensity of suicidal intent in the pesticide users was lowest regardless of the endpoint of death or attempted suicide. Even in the group that had attempted suicide, the score was lower than in those using drugs to attempt suicide; this was inconsistent with the results of our study. The underlying reason may be that the patients admitted to the hospital selected in our study were in critical condition and that the number of patients taking poison was large. Furthermore, we found that the amount of poison taken was highly correlated with the intensity of the patient's suicidal intent, while no detailed clinical data have been reported in previous studies; this may represent one of the reasons for the observed differences in results between our study and previous work.

Moreover, our study showed that 72.0% of the patients with intentional APP did not contact or inform those who could help them before taking action, and that 60.4% of the patients with intentional APP were serious about wanting to end their own life. This is consistent with the results of previous studies among rural suicide attempters. For example, another study in China reported that only 39% of migrant workers sought help when needed, compared with 67% of urban residents (and 86% of non-migrant rural residents). Another study on Australian adults showed that 36.5% of the study participants were likely to seek help from anyone for suicidal thoughts (29), while many other studies have reported a higher prevalence of seeking help (30, 31). Some researchers have suggested that this may be due to the differential stigmatization of suicide in various cultures and populations (32). Chinese researchers have suggested that suicide is more stigmatized in China than in other countries due to the influence of Confucian culture. Since the Chinese are ashamed of suicide, fewer of those who may be experiencing suicidal ideation seek help before committing suicide.

In a previous study of rural suicide attempters in China, marriage was not found to be a protective factor for suicide (33). However, the study found that marriage was a protective factor for suicide attempts, with those who were never married demonstrating a higher degree of suicide attempts than those with a married or “other” (i.e., divorced, widowed, or separated) marital status, which is inconsistent with the results of previous research.

Previous studies have shown that age is a factor affecting suicidal intention. For example, a Spanish study (34) showed that suicidal intention decreased with the increase in age, and young people had higher suicidal intentions than older people. This is inconsistent with the results of this study. However, a study of attempted suicide in China concluded that advanced age could not be considered a risk factor for suicidal intent (35). The underlying reason may be associated with the age of the enrolled population. For example, studies enrolling younger students or school dropouts may show different results, as younger individuals generally have a less established value system and a reduced ability to withstand suffering. Younger individuals experiencing learning disabilities, higher academic pressure, conflicts with classmates, and fierce clashes with parents may cloud results for the many younger individuals with mental disorders enrolled in these studies. In contrast, for somewhat older unmarried men in rural areas, it is frequently difficult or impossible to find a suitable partner or even to pray for a happy marriage. Due to pressure to marry and the stigma and disappointment of failed relationships, many cannot withstand family and peer pressure, which may lead to a higher degree of suicidal intent (including in patients with mental illness).

In previous studies, the higher suicidal intention was frequently associated with mental disorders, and suicide attempts with mental illness have higher suicidal intention (36–38). Eddleston found that 40% of the pesticide group was diagnosed with mental disorders (39). Although the prevalence rate of mental illness diagnosis in this study was relatively low (21.7%), univariate analysis showed that the suicidal intention of patients with untreated mental illness before APP was higher than that of those without mental illness.

In a study, patients with intentional APP who were living in cities showed a higher degree of suicidal intent than those living in rural areas, which is inconsistent with previous research findings (28). Previous studies have speculated that suicide attempters living in rural areas may be more likely to take pesticides due to a lower degree of education, low-income family economic status, and various other reasons than those living in urban areas. Additional contributing factors may be that, barring an interest in purchasing pesticides online or through other means, access to pesticides is lower among urban dwellers; therefore, impulsive suicide attempts using pesticides are certainly less likely.

The study shows that social support is a protective factor for suicidal intent in patients with intentional APP. The higher the level of social support, the lower the level of suicidal intention. This is consistent with the findings of previous research (conducted both domestically and abroad) (40–42). Social support (particularly from family members) provides a support system that can effectively alleviate the psychological or spiritual pain caused by negative life events, thereby meaningfully reducing suicidal intent even in adverse circumstances. A study by Wilcox et al. reported that a low level of social support is a risk factor for persistent suicidal ideation and a predictor of suicide. Cross-cultural studies with large samples have also suggested that a high degree of social support is associated with a low suicide rate and that social support can be used as a clear means of suicide intervention (43).

This study found that patients with intentional APP had a higher incidence of anxiety and depression. This was higher in patients with mental disorders but without severe suicide attempts in a previous investigation conducted in rural China but lower in those with mental disorders and severe suicide attempts (28). Psychological problems in patients with intentional APP deserve attention. The results of the multivariate analysis employed in this study showed that despair was a risk factor for suicidal intent in patients with intentional APP. Moreover, many studies have shown that despair is one of the best predictors of suicide (44, 45), which is also consistent with the results of our study. Underlying reasons may be that people with a higher level of despair tend to be world-weary, lose enthusiasm and confidence in life, and have no hope for the future, thereby increasing their risk of suicidal behavior and leading to a higher level of suicidal intent. In our study, anxiety and depression were risk factors for suicidal intent in patients with intentional APP. Previous studies have demonstrated that suicide attempters with anxiety and depression have stronger suicidal intent (46), which is also consistent with the results of our study.

The results of the single-factor analysis employed in this study showed a correlation between suicidal intent and value strain, wish strain, relative deprivation strain, and coping strain in patients with intentional APP. The results of the multifactor analysis showed that psychological strain still had a predictive effect on suicidal intent when controlling for other relevant factors and that the higher the degree of psychological strain, the stronger the suicidal intent. This was consistent with the findings of the study by Zhang et al. (33) Our study further confirmed that psychological strain also showed a statistically significant predictive effect on suicidal intent in patients with intentional APP.

We have observed that the strain theory of suicide holds that strain exists before the suicide and has a meaningful predictive effect on suicidal behavior. This type of individual strain before suicide has been documented in suicide notes written by American suicide attempters (47). When torque-to-introverted aggression occurs, suicide will occur. In contrast, torque-to-extroverted aggression can lead to criminal behavior against others (48). Therefore, when psychological strain reaches a certain level, we should pay attention and adopt solutions to reduce psychological strain to prevent the occurrence of suicidal or criminal behavior.

Previous studies suggest that a large portion of suicide deaths and suicide attempts in China are impulsive behavior with weak suicidal intentionality, and the characteristics of these individuals are meaningfully different from those with strong suicidal intent (16). In this study, the multifactor analysis showed that impulsivity was a protective factor for suicidal intent in patients with intentional APP, further verifying that intentional APP is a characteristic form of impulsive suicide. A high level of impulsivity, frequently without careful consideration and occurring immediately before the implementation of suicidal behavior, is intuitively associated with lower suicide intentionality.

Previous relevant studies evaluating influencing factors for suicide intentionality have mostly focused on those attempting suicide in rural areas. This study conducted an in-depth analysis of suicidal intent in patients with intentional APP based on clinical data and completed the investigation within 1 week after the occurrence of the suicidal behavior. Moreover, this study evaluated more than 20 relevant factors, including those on demographics, sociology, psychology, and biology. This is conducive to our screening of factors related to suicidal intent in patients with intentional APP to provide a comprehensive and substantive reference for clinical intervention.

However, in addition to these substantial strengths, this study had some notable limitations. First, regarding the sampling methodology, convenience sampling was adopted instead of strictly following the principle of random sampling, which may have led to an inaccurate description of the epidemiological status of APP (i.e., differing from the overall status in the country). Second, this study focused on screening key risk factors without an in-depth discussion of the possible relationships between each factor. Therefore, future research should further explore the relationships between variables and raise the level of research on risk factors to theoretical construction. Third, considering the actual situation, the psychological variables included in this study are not significantly comprehensive, which will be further improved and supplemented in the future.

We found a relatively high level of suicidal intent in the population of patients with intentional APP. Unmarried patients living in cities with high levels of depression, despair, and psychological tension merit appropriate psychological interventions and physical treatment to promote recovery and reduce the incidence of repeated suicide. Therefore, different interventions should be implemented for patients with impulsive suicide attempts and strong social support.

PODGORICA, 25 October 2022 – Having in mind recent suicides and suicide attempts among children in Montenegro, UNICEF is calling for the state to ensure that early signs of risks to children’s wellbeing are detected in a timely manner and that the child and the family are provided with adequate health, child protection and education services to prevent a tragedy happening.

“Suicides are preventable. We urge the national and local authorities to provide quality child, family support and mental health services to prevent suicides, and to ensure that children at risk, and their families, receive timely and quality professional support,” UNICEF Montenegro Representative Juan Santander said.

In Montenegro, UNICEF has supported the establishment of the National SOS Child Helpline 116-111 and the National SOS Parent Helpline 080 888 888. Over the years, UNICEF has supported the strengthening of the capacities of health, social work and education professionals, as well as the design and expansion of services reaching out and supporting children and families. These services must include home visits, family outreach worker service and counselling. With UNICEF’s support, parenting programmes have also been introduced to help caregivers constructively resolve various issues related to raising children. UNICEF has also supported the strengthening of socio-emotional life skills in adolescents through the in-school and out-of-school programme My Values and Virtues, so that every child has opportunities to learn to recognize and manage different emotions effectively.

However, as pointed out in the last EU Progress Report, Montenegro is still struggling with the limited availability and reach of child, family, victim support and mental health services, and the sustainability of the existing services is questionable.

For these reasons, UNICEF is calling for the state to fully meet its obligations from the Convention on the Rights of the Child and ensure the right of every child to life, growth and optimal development. This means that every child and family should be able to access quality child, family, mental health and victim support services. To this end, UNICEF is also appealing for an urgent increase in the number of child and family support outreach workers, child psychologists and psychiatrists across the country.

Children and families in need must be aware at all times of where and to whom they can turn for full support and protection in case they need to. For this reason, UNICEF Montenegro’s young reporters participated in the promotion of the National SOS Child Helpline 116-111. Last week, they spoke to their peers about mental health issues and the video with the voices of Montenegro’s young people on this topic is available here.

“I would recommend to my peers and all young people not to fight their internal battles alone. Seek help or advice, because it is easier when the problem is shared with a trusted person, be it a parent, friend, teacher, or even the free SOS support line for children and young people, available to everyone. You should not be ashamed and be a slave to the stigmatization common in society. This type of help should not be experienced as a defeat or failure, but as a proof of courage, because it is the only way to solve the problem and restore faith in life. Because life is beautiful. And remember, the world rests on us, the young,” said Manja Čalija, a UNICEF Montenegro young reporter involved in the production of the video with the opinions of Montenegro’s adolescents on mental health.

According to last year’s UNICEF global report The State of the World’s Children 2021; On My Mind: promoting, protecting and caring for children’s mental health, more than one in seven adolescents aged 10–19 globally is estimated to be living with a diagnosed mental disorder, and almost 46,000 adolescents globally die from suicide each year – among the top five causes of death for their age group.

The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the mental health situation for people all over the world. While protective factors, such as loving caregivers, safe school environments and positive peer relationships can help reduce the risk of mental disorders, this UNICEF global report warns that significant barriers, including stigmatization and lack of funding, are preventing too many children from accessing the support they need for their mental wellbeing.

Therefore, for a national response to be effective, different sectors – health, education, social and child protection, the police, the judiciary and the media – all need to work together continuously to ensure that high-quality child and family support and mental health services are provided to families all over Montenegro. National and local authorities are responsible for ensuring adequate funding for this purpose.

The below materials were taken from THE ISSUE IS SUICIDE by Ralph L. Rickgarn of the University of Minnesota.

Suicide is not a neutral word. Suicide is not a neutral behavior. As a word, it evokes powerful emotional reactions regardless of the outcome. Fear, anxiety, disbelief and anger are but a few of the emotions that create an atmosphere which impedes involvement in the issues of suicide. As a consequence, attitudes and actions of avoidance and indifference occur. However, with adequate information and the creation of realistic expectations, this avoidance and indifference may be alleviated and replaced with positive actions and reactions.

Suicide is a traumatic event for the individual and for all of those people who have some connection with that person.

Suicide is a highly individualized behavior in reaction to multiple life stressors and interactions that have produced negative or perceived negative outcome.

The following is written to provide a framework of information and some methods of intervention. It is written in the hope that all members of the university will engage in the creation of a caring and confrontative community with some alternatives.

The question for an individual who becomes aware that another person is possibly contemplating suicide is, "Is this person here with me right now wanting to commit suicide and what can I do about it?"

An encounter with a suicidal person is always a deeply emotional experience. There is a fear of not knowing what to do, or doing the wrong thing. But the basic empathic, "I care about you", indicates that there is hope and help, two key ingredients in the intervention process. Misinformation often prevents individuals from becoming involved for fear of making a situation worse. There are many myths about suicide which deter individuals from becoming involved. What are the myths and what are the facts?

MYTH: People who talk about suicide rarely attempt or complete suicide. FACT: Approximately 70-75% of the people who attempt or complete suicide have given some verbal or non-verbal clue to their intentions. MYTH: Asking, "Are you thinking about committing suicide?" will lead the person to a suicide attempt. FACT: Asking direct, caring questions will often minimize the anxiety and act as a deterrent to suicidal behavior. MYTH: The tendency toward suicide is inherited. FACT: Suicide has no characteristic genetic quality. Suicidal patterns in a family are the result of other factors and may result from a belief in the myth which facilitates suicidal actions. MYTH: The suicidal person wants to die. FACT: Suicidal persons often reveal considerable ambivalence about living vs. dying and frequently call for help before and after a suicide attempt. FACT: Depression is often associated with suicidal feelings but not all persons who attempt or commit suicide are depressed. A number of other emotional factors may be involved. FACT: Many persons who have attempted or committed suicide would not have been diagnosed as mentally ill. MYTH: Once an attempt has been made, the suicidal person will always be suicidal. FACT: After a suicide attempt, a person may be able to "manage" and engage in no further suicidal action. MYTH: Suicide is more common in lower socio-economic groups. FACT: Studies of persons who have completed suicide indicate that 50% have sought medical help within six months of their action. FACT: Persons who have attempted or completed suicide usually give some indication of their intended behavior. MYTH: Motives or causes of suicide are readily established. FACT: Suicide is usually a lengthy and complex pattern of behavior where precise motives are difficult to ascertain. FACT: From studies it appears that neither suicide or attempted suicide is significantly related to weather phenomenon. MYTH: Improvement in a suicidal person means the danger is over. FACT: There is a significant danger within the first 90 days after a suicidal person is released from hospitalization. FACT: Suicide prevention by lay persons and centers has been an important, significant part of suicide prevention activities.

These myths and facts were synthesized from works by Blimling and Miltenberger (1981), Resnik (1968), Resnik and Hawthorne (1973) and Schneidman and Farberow (1961).

Approximately 70-75% of the individuals who attempt or commit suicide DO GIVE some indication of their impending action. Gollman (1971) lists some indicators of susceptibility toward self-destruction.
• Chronic Use of Other Chemicals

There is no single pattern or causative factor in suicide. However, most often there is an indication of hopelessness,a great deal of personal pain, and a belief that things are "out of control". These two feelings in particular are strong indicators of potential suicide. All indicators must be taken seriously.

How to respond or begin!
• The best intervention is to ask directly and caringly:

 ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE? Questions like, "You're not thinking of suicide are you?" indicate that the answer you want to hear is, "No, I'm not", and do nothing to facilitate a resolution of the individual's suicidal crisis.

REMEMBER: Asking will not put the idea into the person's head. Relief is often apparent when someone cares and is willing to talk. This can lead to an exploration of alternatives and a release of pent-up feelings.
• Some assessment of the circumstances needs to be made. How lethal is the proposed method of suicide? What are the person's exact intentions? Is there a specific plan? The lethality of the plan can range from a well thought out action involving a very lethal method (hanging, shooting, poisoning, or jumping) to a very low level of lethality (a nebulous idea with little feasibility of succeeding). THE MORE SPECIFIC THE PLAN, THE HIGHER THE RISK. Determining the method available is important. Any pills, guns, knives, should be removed for safekeeping.
• Never promise total confidentiality. Explain that you may need to discuss the situation with another individual in order to provide the best possible service.
• Verbally and non-verbally indicate your genuine concern. Be willing to discuss the suicidal thoughts and feelings of the individual.
• If possible, involve the person in a SUICIDE CONTRACT (this can be done verbally or in writing). Contracts can serve as a block to behavior. Sounds strange, but it works.
• Refer the individual to an appropriate agency for assistance. Be willing to accompany the person to the initial contact session or intake. Support is very important.

An attempted or completed suicide is always a traumatic experience in any setting. The survivors have to deal with the initial shock element and the aftermath of the trauma. Different reactions are experienced by peers, colleagues, staff, friends, faculty, parents , and significant others. Particularly in a residence hall, staff need to be aware of these reactions in order to respond appropriately.

Any or all of the following may be present:
• Anger - Both at the person and at self.
• Blame - "I should have been able to..."
• Guilt - "It's my fault for not ...."

These are some of the most common reactions. Grief is a common reaction in survivors. Individuals may experience periods of denial, rage, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Grief is not measured only in fears and withdrawal, but equally in life, continuing to survive, grow and reach out to others.

"The person who commits suicide puts his psychological skeleton in the survivor's closet." (Schneidman, 1969, p.22)

Where there is a completed suicide or an attempt, Schneidman's statement rather succinctly defines what happens. Individuals do not want to be placed in the position of having to cope with someone's "psychological skeleton" Consequently, the tendency to avoid or to appear indifferent toward suicide occurs. Hopefully, with information and the development of a caring, responding attitude, the University community can respond to individuals who are suicidal in a positive and confrontative manner. And this same caring can also be shown to the survivors.

Health information data for mental and brain health conditions is often lacking at country level or limited to certain geographic regions or demographics. In particular, low- and middle-income countries have limited epidemiological and health systems data.

The Department of Mental Health and Substance Use assists countries in strengthening health information systems for mental and brain health conditions through ongoing projects such as the Mental Health ATLAS and Neurology ATLAS or the Global Dementia Observatory (GDO).

The department’s efforts also support the global monitoring of relevant WHA mandates and UN SDG targets with indicators 3.4.2 (reduction of suicide mortality), 3.5.1 (treatment coverage for substance use disorders) and 3.5.2 (alcohol consumption). To find out more about the Department’s contributions to SDG monitoring see here: suicide reduction and alcohol/substance use.

Global research for mental and brain health conditions remains highly fragmented, with broad variability in levels of investment and quality of research, creating an urgent need to strengthen global research infrastructure, especially in low-income settings. Ensuring research harmonization and investigative approaches that cover prevention, treatment and cure, while ensuring research efforts are rooted in equity, diversity, and inclusiveness, is of critical importance.

WHO facilitates regular communication and information exchange between stakeholders in countries of all income levels in support of a globally-connected mental and brain health research community.


988 is now the three-digit dialing code that routes callers to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (or 988 Lifeline). On July 16, 2022, the 988 Lifeline transitioned away from the National Suicide Prevention Line reached through a 10-digit number to the three-digit 988 Lifeline. It is funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and administered by Vibrant Emotional Health (Vibrant).

When people call, text, or chat with the 988 Lifeline, they are connected to trained crisis counselors who are part of the existing 988 Lifeline network, made up of over 200 local crisis centers. These crisis counselors are trained to provide free and confidential emotional support and crisis counseling to people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress and connect them to resources. These services are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, across the United States.

The previous 988 Lifeline phone number (1-800-273-8255) will always remain available to people in emotional distress or suicidal crisis.

The 988 Lifeline’s network of over 200 crisis centers has been in operation since 2005 and has been proven to be effective. Trained crisis counselors listen, provide support, and connect callers to resources when appropriate.

Callers who follow the “press 1” prompt are connected to the Veterans Crisis Line. A Spanish Language line is available by pressing 2, and more than 240 languages are supported through a Tele-Interpreters service. Callers now also have the option of following a “press 3” prompt to be connected to a crisis counselor specifically trained in supporting LGBTQI+ callers.

Numerous studies have shown that callers feel less suicidal, less depressed, less overwhelmed, and more hopeful after speaking with a 988 Lifeline crisis counselor.

Answer the call! 988 Lifeline centers are looking to bring on new volunteers and paid employees. You will receive training, so if you are looking to make a difference for those in crisis, apply today. Find your opportunity: 988lifeline.org/careers

Grant Title: Real-time assessments of suicidality among Black men: a mixed methods approach To help prevent suicides, researchers are looking into using smartphone apps that collect real-time data about people's thoughts and feelings throughout the day. This method, known as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), could provide valuable insights. In the United States, the number of suicides among Black men has been rising, but the EMA method hasn’t been well studied with Black men experiencing suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). To examine whether Black men find it acceptable and practical to use a smartphone app for tracking STB, Dr. Leslie Adams recruited 10 Black men aged 18 and older with a history of suicidal thoughts or behaviors. For a week, participants received four daily prompts for short surveys on their mental state, depression, social isolation, and feelings of being a burden, along with nightly surveys on sleep quality and discrimination experiences. An end-of-study interview was also conducted. Most participants found the app acceptable and practical, despite some technical issues and repetitive questions. Some participants reported they felt worse after answering questions about suicide, which has not been found in other studies with different populations. These results indicate that smartphone-based data collection is feasible but more understanding about accounting for cultural differences is needed to improve effectiveness and user experience for Black men.

Over the past 20 years, the number of suicides involving opioids has doubled, contributing to a serious public health problem. People who die by suicide and those who die by accidental opioid overdose exhibit many similar risk factors. While the trends and characteristics for both death by suicide and death by opioid overdose have been researched separately, the role of opioids in suicide is less known. There is also a growing hypothesis that a substantial portion of opioid-involved suicide deaths also involve other substances (i.e., polysubstance opioid suicide), but it is unclear if the characteristics of individuals who die by polysubstance opioid suicide differ from those who solely die by opioid overdose. Dr. Ryoko Susukida and her team analyzed data from 12,038 people who died in Maryland between 2006 and 2020, comparing those who died by suicide involving opioids (947 people), those who died by suicide without opioids (6,896 people), and those who accidentally died from opioid overdoses (4,125 people). They also examined people who died by suicide involving opioids and other drugs (polysubstance use). The team found that people who died by opioid-involved suicide were more frequently aged 18-64, non-Hispanic Whites, and unemployed or disabled than people who died by suicide with other methods. When compared to people who died by accidental opioid overdose, those who died by suicide involving opioids were more likely to be female, under 18 years old, non-Hispanic Whites, and those who were employed. Nearly half of the people who died by suicide involving opioids had other drugs involved as well, particularly among non-Hispanic Whites. These results suggest that people who died by suicide with opioids require special attention when developing suicide prevention interventions. Citation: Susukida, R., Nestadt, P.

Grant Title: Virtual Interaction Training in Emotional Self-Awareness for Working with Suicidal Patients Clinicians working with suicidal patients often experience high stress, which can contribute to negative emotional responses. These negative emotions can contribute to clinicians being less empathic, and they may unintentionally push patients away, harming the therapeutic relationship and worsening patient outcomes. Therefore, clinicians may need additional training on emotional self-awareness and empathic communication to manage potential negative emotions and improve their effectiveness with suicidal patients. One way of achieving this is with virtual human interaction training (VHI), which presents clinicians with virtually developed patients exhibiting a variety of clinical scenarios while measuring clinical effectiveness and empathic communication. As part of a multi-site linked AFSP grant, Dr. Igor Galynker and Dr. Benjamin Lok tested two virtual human interaction training conditions: one with instructions on verbal empathic communication and reminders to report negative emotions during virtual sessions (i.e., scaffolded), and one without any reminders or instructions (i.e., non-scaffolded). Sixty-two clinicians participated in three VHI sessions. Results showed that negative emotions decreased in both groups after two training sessions. The scaffolded group improved empathic communication after one training session, while the non-scaffolded group improved after two. Surprisingly, the non-scaffolded group had better clinical efficacy after two training sessions, while the scaffolded group did not. It turns out this was likely due to the method of providing reminders which may have been distracting. These results support VHI’s ability to improve emotional awareness and empathic communication in clinicians and suggest that nonverbal expressions of empathy may be crucial for working with suicidal patients.

Grant Title: Imaging of the Suicidal Brain in Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that has been associated with risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. One hypothesis about what could contribute to this risk, called the “accelerated age hypothesis,” theorizes that several clinical features typically associated with older age that are experienced by individuals with schizophrenia (e.g., increased risk of cognitive impairment, inflammation, oxidative stress, and reduction of telomere length in blood cells) may play a part in increasing risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. With this in mind, Dr. Ali Bani-Fatemi and his team examined DNA from blood samples of adults with schizophrenia who had a history of suicide attempts, as well as of a separate group of adults with schizophrenia with no history of suicide attempts. Dr. Bani-Fatemi found that those who had attempted suicide showed signs of being 10.7 years older biologically (i.e., in their cells) than chronologically (i.e., their age in years). This accelerated aging was evident in both males and females, with males showing slightly more pronounced differences. The findings suggest that the stress and severity of schizophrenia might accelerate aging, increasing suicide risk. Measuring biological age could help identify increased risk for suicide in individuals with schizophrenia who may benefit from specifically tailored treatments that take biological aging into account.

WASHINGTON, D.C. (July 25, 2024) – The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) commends U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy for releasing a new advisory today: Firearm Violence: A Public Health Crisis in America. Tragically, suicides by firearm comprise more than half (55% in 2022) of all suicide deaths in the United States. AFSP encourages several community-based approaches to prevent firearm suicide, several of which are reflected by the Surgeon General’s advisory, as well as the 2024 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention. These approaches must include collaborative suicide prevention education efforts within gun-owning communities.

Research shows that the risk of suicide is greater when firearms or other lethal means are present in the home or readily accessible. Ensuring that a person at acute risk for suicide does not have easy access to a firearm saves lives; research has consistently shown that when a chosen method of suicide is not accessible, most individuals will not move on to another method of suicide and if they do, it is less likely to be lethal. In addition, suicidal urges can intensify quickly so easy access to lethal means can be fatal; putting time and space between a person in crisis and lethal means allows time for the acute urge to pass and for the person to engage with healthy coping strategies.

AFSP strongly encourages further support at the state and federal levels of government for legislation, policies, funding and executive action to prioritize firearms-related research, provide education on the relationship between suicide and firearms, implement voluntary firearm removal initiatives, expand lethal means education and counseling practices within healthcare systems, and increase access to mental health, substance use, and trauma-informed care. These include:
• Continued investment in mental health and crisis care services. AFSP urges lawmakers at the state and federal levels to prioritize sustained investment in mental health services and crisis care support. This includes the need for full implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act which will save lives, including through the expansion of school-based mental health services and professionals.
• Training for healthcare professionals on lethal means safety counseling, screening for suicide risk, and making referrals to mental health resources and care. Individuals with heightened risk for suicide are often seen in clinical settings, particularly emergency departments. Incentivizing health systems to implement suicide prevention protocols, including training health professionals to identify, support, and provide referrals for patients who may be at elevated risk will help save lives. When a patient’s suicide risk is detected if the patient has access to a firearm in the home, healthcare professionals should work with the patient and their family when possible on voluntary strategies to store household firearms away from the home, or otherwise ensure secure firearm storage, until the patient recovers.
• Public investments to support research regarding firearms and suicide prevention. More data are needed on which firearm policies are most effective in preventing suicide, which educational efforts are most effective in promoting secure firearm storage, and how best to bring promising practices to scale so we can implement more widespread change nationwide. This includes AFSP’s strong support for continued federal investment in gun violence prevention research.
• Community storage options and temporary transfer exceptions. When an individual is at risk for suicide, being able to store firearms outside the home can save lives. This includes storage options at gun shops, shooting ranges, police departments, community lockers, and other special storage facilities. To support the ability for an individual in crisis to store their firearm outside the home, AFSP supports temporary transfer exceptions in background check laws in cases of suicide risk.
• Voluntary do-not-sell list programs. These are lists where individuals can register themselves to voluntarily restrict their own ability to purchase and/or own a firearm. Only the person in question can enter themselves onto such a voluntary do-not-sell list, and the list is used for no other purpose than for firearm purchases or firearm ownership. AFSP supports the establishment of voluntary do-not-sell lists at both the state and federal levels and commends the multiple states that have successfully established voluntary do-not-sell lists.
• Laws that call for the creation and dissemination of educational materials and/or training on the relationship between access to lethal means and suicide prevention, and secure firearms storage. These include efforts to publish and distribute brochures on firearms safety and suicide prevention, distribute secure firearm storage devices, educate firearms instructors and clinicians in lethal means safety, and to put suicide prevention information on firearm warning labels and on the premises of licensed firearm dealers.
• Extreme risk protection orders. AFSP urges policymakers at all levels of government to support policy initiatives to allow for extreme risk protection orders (ERPOs) to be used as a tool to help prevent suicide when voluntary efforts to separate an at-risk individual from firearms are unsuccessful or impossible and suicide risk is imminent.

AFSP appreciates the Surgeon General’s leadership, and we look forward to working alongside our chapters, partners, and policymakers to promote the advisory and save lives.

MALVERN PA, (June 18, 2024) — Actress, humanitarian, and author Ashley Judd will speak at HMP Global’s 2024 Psych Congress national meeting, participating in a fireside chat with American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) Chief Medical Officer Christine Yu Moutier, MD, about mental health, grief, and loss.

Psych Congress, America’s leading conference on practical psychopharmacology, will be held October 29 – November 2 in Boston. In partnership with AFSP, Psych Congress delivers critical education resources for mental health clinicians aimed at preventing suicides.

Judd became a passionate advocate for suicide prevention and privacy protections for loss survivors after her mother, renowned country singer Naomi Judd, died by suicide in April 2022. Among her recent work, Judd and singer-songwriter Aloe Blacc worked with the Biden administration to unveil and promote the 2024 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and its accompanying Federal Action Plan, a comprehensive, 10-year strategy for addressing mental healthcare gaps and meeting the needs of at-risk populations.

“Ashley Judd has done tremendous work to strengthen protections for the loss survivor community and create public awareness about the role we can all play in preventing suicide,” said Dr. Moutier. “AFSP is honored to be working alongside her and our partners at Psych Congress to strengthen the ability of healthcare providers on the front lines to deliver mental health interventions and resources that save lives.”

“We are proud to partner with AFSP to host Ashley Judd at this year’s meeting, as we work together to educate clinicians and develop life-saving strategies for at-risk patients,” said Psych Congress Co-Chair Rakesh Jain, MD, MPH. “Nearly 50,000 people in the United Stated died by suicide in 2022. This is an urgent public health challenge.”

Educational Program

Psych Congress’ five-day educational program includes over 100 psychopharmacology focused sessions presented by more than 50 internationally renowned faculty presenters. Three pre-conferences are scheduled this year, including PA Institute, covering the essentials for psychiatric physician assistants; Advanced Psychopharmacology Institute, featuring four cutting-edge, emerging therapies; and Psychedelics Preconference.

A welcome session debate, “Psychedelics in Psychiatry,” will delve into the polarizing topic of psychedelics in psychiatry, featuring Steering Committee member Charles Raison, MD, and — taking the Psych Congress stage for the first time — Stephen Stahl, MD, PhD. New this year, a MATE Act Training post conference will be held, where participants can fulfill the new DEA requirement for 8 hours of training on opioid or substance use disorders, required for all prescribers.

“Psych Congress continues to expand and enhance its agenda, offering more practical psychopharmacology content than any other conference, and enabling mental health professionals improve patient care and outcomes,” said Psych Congress Co-Chair Greg Mattingly, MD.

Partners include the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry, AFSP, the Association of Physician Assistants in Psychiatry, Caregiver Action Network, Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, the International Society of Reproductive Psychiatry, and the Schizophrenia & Psychosis Action Alliance.

Psych Congress is designed and accredited for all members of the mental health team. For more information, sponsorship options, or to register, visit psychcongress.com.

Each May, our country shines a spotlight on two important issues, through Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month and Mental Health Awareness Month. Technically, these are two separate awareness holidays. But for me, my mental health and Asian American identity feel closely intertwined — so I have always found the overlap of these two moments a perfect, cosmic coincidence, and an opportunity for self-reflection. In addition to working through the connection between my own mental health, racial heritage, and immigrant background, I have also aimed to help others do the same.

From a young age, I struggled to understand the incongruence I felt between the Asian and American aspects of my identity. But one day, a fellow immigrant explained that feeling of incongruence quite simply and beautifully. For those of us who bridge two worlds, we often experience three cultures: first, our culture of origin; second, the culture to which we immigrate; and third, a culture born from the experiences of balancing between the first two. For me, a former orphan from South Korea, I became used to strangers assuming that my parents were also Asian, that I was most likely Buddhist, and that their children could seek my help as a math tutor. In reality, I grew up with many of the usual American symbols of Midwest domesticity: church on Sundays, Friday dinners at Pizza Hut, and Saturdays spent roaming the local mall. Each time a stranger made assumptions about me, I would smile and politely laugh it off, but those misconceptions only deepened my uncertainty about where I belonged. If I didn’t fit in with my white peers, and I no longer fit in with my Asian peers, where did I belong? As I have continued to be more open in my discussions of mental health and my personal exploration of identity, I have learned that this friction, this internal battle to navigate one’s third culture, is a common journey for many immigrants.

As both a Volunteer Advocate for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention’s North Dakota Chapter (through which I help AFSP’s public policy office pass important suicide prevention policies at the state and federal level) and the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Liaison for Clay County Public Health just a short drive over in Minnesota, I have seen firsthand the mental and emotional struggles experienced by families navigating third cultures. In both of these roles, I have the opportunity to engage with diverse populations and explore ways that we can improve our community’s health services. Many of the people I work with have resettled in the U.S. as refugees of war or persecution in their homelands. The process of relocation alone can be mentally and emotionally traumatic. But on top of that, they are also navigating the pressure of trying to carry forward ethnic traditions while still integrating new and unfamiliar American practices.

When I sit with these families and listen to their stories of struggle, I always feel compelled to share as many mental health resources as possible, including the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline number, 988. As a Volunteer Advocate for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, and also as a community health worker, I know firsthand that the implementation of 988 was a profound milestone and a critical step toward decreasing national suicide rates.

At the same time, as I continue to work with and observe families who exist in third culture spaces, I have come to realize that the fundamental concept of 988, like much of our behavioral health support systems, is deeply rooted in American principles. Reaching outside of the family for help, talking about deeply personal feelings and thoughts with a stranger, and even using the term “mental health” are all practices that can contradict those of many of our New American families. (The term "New American" is one we have come to use locally in many nonprofit circles when referring to immigrants and asylum seekers, since labels like "refugee" can carry a lot of stigma, and can even create barriers to employment due to discrimination.)

In Clay County, where I work, a large percentage of New Americans speak Kurdish, Arabic, Somali, and French. Because of this, our Public Health Center has translated 988 informational flyers into each of those languages. This update to Clay County's mental health resources has not only allowed us to reach a wider audience, but it has also opened the door to even more conversations about how to improve our crisis services.

At the height of the pandemic, many public health workers saw the gap in health equity widening for racially marginalized people. Our county government recognized this issue taking place on a local level, and took action by creating my position as DEI Liaison. In addition, they began working with individuals from our New American communities to better understand ways to provide culturally competent health services, including mental health services. Engaging in this collaborative work meant meeting people in familiar gathering spaces, talking through and addressing common questions, including whether 988 provides interpreters for non-English speakers (the answer, by the way, is yes! And for an incredible 240-some languages!). Together, county government and New American communities have also established critical training like Mental Health First Aid and removed barriers to access like cost, which was possible because of a partnership with our local AFSP chapter.

In 2020, when the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline was signed into law, advocates across the country celebrated the historic moment, while still knowing the work of implementation was just beginning. Four years later, as communities like mine continue to grow and diversify, defining the fight of building a better and more adaptive mental health crisis system continues to evolve. So, as I pause to reflect and acknowledge both Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month and Mental Health Awareness month, I am hopeful and inspired to see a future where suicide prevention ultimately reaches every corner and every culture in our country.

WASHINGTON — (June 5, 2024), The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) is hosting its 15th Annual Advocacy Forum from June 9 to 12, 2024, in Washington, D.C. Nearly 250 Volunteer Advocates from across the country will gather at the nation’s capital to call on Congress to prioritize lifesaving suicide prevention and mental health policies. On June 11, Advocates will meet with over 250 Congressional offices to share their personal stories and urge them to co-sponsor and support vital legislation for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline and the full continuum of crisis care. AFSP will also honor members of Congress and their staff who have been critical and leading champions in the efforts to support the 988 Lifeline and suicide prevention.

Preventing suicide is an urgent public health matter. In 2022, 49,476 people died by suicide, making it the 11th leading cause of death in the country. AFSP and its network of Volunteer Advocates are meeting this moment by focusing on legislation supporting the 988 Lifeline, which provides behavioral health support to people who experience or want to support someone in suicidal crisis or emotional distress 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, across the United States. After enacting the three-digit dialing code in July 2022, the 988 Lifeline received nearly four million contacts during its first year in use, which was a 33 percent increase from the year before. It is an intervention proven to save lives.

“AFSP Volunteer Advocates have seen many wins over the past 15 years of our advocacy movement, including the establishment of the three-digit dialing code for the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline securing millions in funding for research at the National Institutes of Mental Health and funding for comprehensive suicide prevention programming at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” said AFSP Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer Laurel Stine. “We all have a role to play in preventing suicide, and our Advocates are proof that every call, letter, email, meeting and story shared makes a difference.”

During meetings with members of Congress and their staff, AFSP Volunteer Advocates will call for support on legislation that will increase awareness, local response rates and wraparound services for the 988 Lifeline. This legislation includes:
• None This Act will require colleges and universities to provide contact information for the 988 Lifeline on student ID cards, or if not, then issued via websites/student portals. I n the U.S., 82% of people are not familiar with 988. Making it easy for students to find and share the 988 number will improve access to lifesaving crisis resources and destigmatize reaching out for help.
• None ): This will require carriers to route wireless calls and texts based on the proximity of an individual to a contact center rather than on the area code while protecting a caller’s privacy. The bill also requires that multi-line systems support the direct dialing of 988, rather than requiring a caller to dial another number first. 988 is about more than answering calls. It’s also about connecting people to local services, support and resources at critical moments making this bill essential.
• None To authorize $30 million for a new federal grant program to help eligible 988 contact centers provide follow-up services to individuals who received suicide prevention and crisis services. Follow-up services such as check-in calls and collaboration with loved ones can be critical to helping people in crisis; 80% of surveyed crisis line callers reported that follow-up services helped save their lives.

“It's inspiring to work together with advocates from all over the country at the AFSP Forum. By speaking to legislators about important policies that will address mental health and suicide, I can truly be the voice for suicide prevention,” said Wyoming Volunteer Advocate Donna Birkholz. “I have lost friends and family to suicide, but also have friends and family who got help and survived. 988 is a crucial tool for helping more people find the support they need, when they need it.”

Forum attendees will learn strategies to impact legislation and hear from experts on the 988 Lifeline and continuum of crisis care working to expand 988 nationally and at the state level including:
• None Deputy Chief of Staff and Director of Communications, Office of U.S. Representative Don Beyer (VA-8)

Keynote presentations will be given by:

Video remarks will be provided by:

This year, AFSP will bring back the Allies in Action Awards Program. Awards will be presented on Tuesday, June 11 on Capitol Hill to members of Congress and their staff who have been champions and critical in the efforts to support the 988 Lifeline and suicide prevention.

Attendance at the Forum is by invitation only; however, AFSP also hosts a Virtual Advocacy Forum open to the public. It will begin at noon ET on Tuesday, June 11, on AFSP’s Facebook and YouTube channels. Everyone can support AFSP’s legislative priorities and contact their members of Congress through the AFSP Action Center—every voice makes a difference!

Grant Title: Development and Feasibility Testing of a Suicide Prevention Intervention for Sexual and Gender Minority Youth With the increase in youth having access to online platforms in recent years, online victimization (OV) is a growing issue that has been linked to suicide risk for adolescents. OV can take the form of disparaging remarks, images, or behaviors that cause harm. Experiences of OV have disproportionately impacted LGBTQ youth, who are three times as likely to attempt suicide as non-LGBTQ youth. While social media can provide important benefits for youth through connection and affirming resources, current interventions and services contain gaps in supporting LGBTQ youth who experience OV. With this in mind, Dr. Candice Biernesser and her team developed Flourish, a digital suicide prevention intervention for LGBTQ youth who have faced online victimization. To codesign Flourish, Dr. Biernesser conducted qualitative interviews with 20 LGBTQ youth with a history of experiencing OV and suicidal thoughts and behaviors along with 11 of their parents, and 10 LGBTQ-focused professionals. After identifying priorities for the service based on feedback, the team developed a partially automated, text message intervention leveraging web-based content to create a safe space for LGBTQ youth to seek support for OV through education, coping skills, and help-seeking resources. The team then conducted prototype testing with a different group of 10 LGBTQ adolescents which yielded excellent usability ratings. The next step for Dr. Biernesser and her team is to test the feasibility and efficacy of Flourish in a larger sample.

Peer and bullying victimization refer to the repeated experience of being the target of aggressive behavior, such as being pushed or hit, called names, made fun of, or being excluded from a group. It is often characterized by an imbalance of power between the perpetrator and the victim. Research has shown that bullying victimization in childhood has been linked with an increased risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, but no study has yet explored the possibility of an increased risk of dying by suicide. To explore this gap, Dr. Marie-Claude Geoffroy and her team conducted a 50-year nationwide cohort study using data from the 1958 British Birth Cohort, which is an ongoing longitudinal study of 17,638 individuals born within one week of each other in March 1958. Dr. Geoffroy conducted analyses on 14,946 individuals whose mothers reported bullying victimization for their children at ages 7 and 11. Of the subgroup, 55 people had died by suicide between the ages of 18-52 years old. Though the effect was small, having been bullied was associated with death by suicide when other factors weren’t considered. It’s unclear if this effect would hold with more information, but the importance of implementing suicide prevention efforts in childhood is supported by these findings. Citation: Geoffroy, M. C., Arseneault, L., Girard, A., Ouellet-Morin, I., & Power, C. (2023). Association of childhood bullying victimisation with suicide deaths: findings from a 50-year nationwide cohort study.

Grant Title: What Reduces Suicide Ideation in Online Crisis Chats? A Study of Crisis Counselor & Client Processes When people experience suicidal crises, they often struggle with relationships, which can contribute to difficulties in forming a therapeutic bond with clinicians. Even though research has shown that building a strong relationship between clinician and client is crucial for effective outcomes in therapy, especially for those thinking about suicide, we don’t know much about how relationship struggles show up in therapy sessions. We also don’t know much about how relationship struggles can impact one-time crisis therapy sessions. With this is mind, Dr. Daniel Cox and his team looked at how the relationship between crisis counselor and client affects the client's desire to die by suicide and examined the outcomes of one-time, 30-minute online crisis therapy sessions. Dr. Cox analyzed 354 sessions with clients who were actively suicidal and using an online crisis service for the first time. The team measured suicidal desire, the strength of the therapeutic relationship throughout the sessions, and the outcomes (e.g., acceptance of referral to external services and acceptance of crisis-center follow-up). The results indicated that a strong relationship between crisis counselor and client helped reduce suicidal desire and led to better outcomes. These results highlight the importance of training therapists on how to build strong relationships with clients who are in acute suicidal crises.

Grant Title: An Integrated Approach to Understanding the Biology of Suicidal Behavior In the field of suicide prevention research, some scientists have focused on finding genetic differences that are specifically active for people who die by suicide. This search is complicated by both the biological and methodological challenges of conducting genetic research. While some genetic markers have been found before, many are still unknown, especially those affecting how genes work in the brain. Dr. Virginia Willour and her team looked at the genetic data from specific brain areas of people who died by suicide to see how gene activity might relate to suicide risk. They studied data from 986 suicide cases and 415 non-suicide controls, using information collected from several genetic databases. The team found differences in one specific genetic marker (rs926308) that is linked to lower activity of a gene (RFPL3S) important for brain development and arousal. They also identified 20 other genes that could potentially be related to suicide risk. Ten of these genes are also linked to mental health disorders like schizophrenia and autism, which can be associated with suicide. This study provides new insights into the genetic and biological mechanisms that might lead to suicide. Further study of the functions these genes serve is needed.

Trauma is an emotional response to a terrible event. If you are experiencing difficult emotions any day—and especially now—your feelings are valid. You are not alone.
• Physical . Symptoms not related to a medical condition like stomach pain, muscle tension and headaches, change in sleep and/or eating patterns.
• Daily functioning . Trouble concentrating, disengaging from things you normally enjoy.
• Emotional. Increased sense of fear, unable to get images/stories out of your head, guilt, hypervigilance.
• Spiritual/morality. Questioning the inherent good in people, wondering why this would happen.
• Social/occupational. Withdrawing from friends and family, calling out sick at work/school because of fear or other non-physical illness related reasons.

Many of us are in positions to care for others while also tending to our own needs, such as parents, teachers, first responders, mental health professionals, etc. It is important to find a balance that works for your unique situation to acknowledge your emotions and validate them for both yourself and others.

If you are experiencing difficult emotions, here are some ways to cope:
• Reach out for support . You don’t have to go through hard things alone. Text HOME to 741741 to reach a volunteer Crisis Counselor. We’re here for you.
• Listen to your body. Ask yourself ‘where am I feeling discomfort in my body?’ It helps some people to actually write out the answer to this question. Understanding where your body holds discomfort can help you better manage it.
• Ground yourself . Name 5 things you can see, name 4 things you can feel, name 3 things you can hear, name 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste.
• Trust yourself. If you have experienced trauma in your past, you likely used some coping skills. You are stronger than you might think and you know yourself best. Make a list of previously used coping skills and see if there are any of those you can try at this moment.
• Set boundaries . Take time to reflect on your own boundaries. Use this self awareness to determine when you are able to support others and when you are not. Take a break from the media to manage your exposure to traumatic stories.
• Mental health support . Find mental health resources in your area with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)’s

If you’re watching news about gun violence unfold, you may also be wondering how you can help. Here are some of the tips we share with our volunteer Crisis Counselors who are supporting people who are texting in crisis because of gun violence.
• Validate feelings . If someone confides in you about how they’re struggling to cope, it’s important to validate and acknowledge how they’re feeling. Try phrases like, “I’m hearing you feel enraged and devastated by what happened,” or “I can hear how (infuriating, exhausting, heartbreaking) this is for you.”
• Help them find connection . If someone is in crisis, it may be helpful for them to find connection to their friends or family. But, you can’t be there for everyone all the time. Help them identify a shortlist of people or resources to turn to who can give them the support they need.
• Encourage them to take care of their mental health. It can be hard for people to step away to take care of themselves. Show your support by helping them identify a few small things they can do to prioritize their mental health. This could include taking a break from media, going outside, listening to music, and more.

With the layers of trauma and violence unfolding in front of us, it’s understandable to feel sadness, grief, anxiety, and everything in between. Your feelings are valid. Crisis Text Line is here to listen and offer support. The bravest thing you can do is to reach out. Text HOME to 741741 to reach a volunteer Crisis Counselor.

People can feel anxious about a lot of things: the first day of school, a job interview, a first date. Anxiety is that pang of “what if” that makes your heart race and your palms sweaty. There’s a difference between healthy anxiety and a paralyzing fear about the future.

If you’re experiencing anxiety, know that you’re not alone. Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health disorders in the U.S. They affect over 40 million adults every single year. Kids experience them too: over 25% of people between 13 and 18 live with anxiety today.

If you’re feeling anxious, even thinking through the steps for how to tackle it could feel overwhelming. You shouldn’t have to summit that mountain alone. So, here are some steps to get you started:
• Text us. If your mind is racing a million miles a minute, you want help now. Like, right now. Good thing we’re here 24/7 to help you work through your anxious thoughts and get to cool and calm. Text CONNECT to 741741 to connect with a real human.
• Blow off some steam. Exercise is important for both your physical and mental health. If your thoughts are racing and you’re feeling overwhelmed, try lacing up your shoes and going for a walk, tapping it back in a spin class, or getting into flow at yoga.
• Get some Zzzzs. Set yourself up to get your solid 6-8 hours every night by finding a routine that works for you.
• Talk to a pro. Managing your mental health is part of managing your health. Finding the right doctor could help you hone in on the thoughts and situations that lead to your anxiety.

Symptoms are different for everyone. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, some symptoms can include:

Crisis Text Line can help you manage with our text hotline for anxiety. Struggling? Text a Crisis Counselor at 741741, or use the mobile text button below to text from your phone.

People are all different—and so is anxiety. According to the American Psychiatric Association, the most common anxiety disorders are:
• None Generalized Anxiety Disorder: excessive worry that is disproportionate to normal anxiousness around upcoming life events (such as work or school)
• None Social Anxiety Disorder: intense fear of social interactions, making it hard to go out, make friends, or interact with others
• None Panic Disorder: recurrent panic attacks that cause someone to change their behavior in order to avoid having them. Panic attacks are not your regular grade freak out; they’re an intense physical reaction to fear often causing an accelerated heart rate, sweating, and difficulty breathing.
• None Separation Anxiety Disorder: fear of being separated from someone usually because of worry that something may happen to them while they’re away
• None Specific Phobias: intense fear about a specific thing or situation (ex. spiders, heights, flying)

Sometimes people experience anxiety along with other mental health disorders. Many people also experience depression. And, while people may experience both disorders, it’s important to note that they have different symptoms and causes.

Think of anxiety and panic as cousins: they’re linked, though not always one and the same. It’s common to have panic attacks as a fear response with anxiety disorders. It’s also possible to have an occasional panic attack without having a disorder. Panic attacks can be scary—they often feel like a heart attack. The good news? They don’t do any long-term damage to your body. That doesn’t mean they aren’t a big deal.

Stress is a totally normal and expected response to situations and changes in our lives. Anxiety can also manifest as a response to stress. The trick is identifying when healthy levels of stress transition to disproportionate levels of anxiety around particular situations or events.

Simply put, no one thing causes anxiety. However, there are a few things that can increase your risk:
• None Genetics. Researchers have found that people who develop anxiety disorders before the age of 20 likely also have a relative who lives with anxiety.
• None Brain Chemistry. Science shows that stress can change the chemical balance in the brain. So it is no surprise that this chemical change can affect your mood.
• None Personality. For some people, their personality can make them predisposed to certain anxiety disorders.
• None Life Events. Traumatic events can change our lives…they can also change our brains. Sometimes, anxiety can manifest around large or challenging life changes.
• None Trauma. Acute and prolonged trauma can contribute to both intermittent and long-term anxiety. For example, that leads to anxiety in both the systemic ways it manifests in our society and the individual inflection points.

Anxiety can feel overwhelming. It’s also highly treatable. Some common treatments include:
• None Deep Breaths. Focus on your breathing to calm and center yourself.
• None Stress Less. Stress management techniques such as exercise, meditation, and mindfulness can help manage stress.
• None Get some shut-eye. Maintaining a regular sleep schedule can regulate your mood and stress.
• None Talk to a professional. A therapist may be able to help you manage triggers and symptoms. Therapists and doctors may also prescribe medication to help manage your mental health.
• None It’s always okay to ask for help. In fact, asking for help is brave. Looking to get started? Try talking to your doctor to learn more about how you are feeling and ways to take care of your mental health.

What is an eating disorder?

You’ve likely heard about eating disorders in your daily life. Eating disorders are physical and mental illnesses that cause people to severely alter their eating behaviors and related thoughts and emotions (Source). They are complex mental health conditions that may require support and eating disorder treatment.

If you’re living with disordered eating and struggling with your body image, you’re not alone. What you’re going through is painful. Support is here for you.

Simply text CONNECT to 741741 to immediately connect with a trained volunteer who is ready to listen and support you through difficult times. Reach out now and know that you are not alone.

It’s difficult to pinpoint the exact meaning of depression, as it is experienced differently by everyone. Some might say that depression is a feeling that nothing matters that is so strong it interferes with one’s ability to function in the world. School? Work? Social life? With depression, getting out of bed each morning can feel like climbing Mount Everest. The good news is that you do not have to climb the mountain alone. Asking for help could allow you to unlock the tools that make the climb easier.

Depression is like having a dark cloud follow you around, dampening your mood and zapping away your energy. It’s a mental health condition that can make everyday life feel overwhelming and it often leads to persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest in once-loved activities. It’s important to understand depression because it’s more common than you might think – nearly 1 in 3 Crisis Text Line conversations discussed depression in 2022. By recognizing and empathizing with depression, we can support ourselves and others, break the stigma surrounding mental health, and create a more compassionate and understanding society. Remember, seeking help is a courageous step toward finding light in the midst of darkness.
• None Major life stressors, including trauma or life changes such as the end of a relationship, a family loss, moving, or changing careers
• None Women in their late teens to early 30s are at increased risk

Living with depression can feel like navigating through a foggy maze, where even the simplest tasks become daunting challenges. It’s a common mental health issue that many people deal with at some point in their lives, either in unpredictable bouts or as a constant state they must continually manage. The cycle of depression, characterized by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and low self-worth, can trap individuals in a frustrating loop, reinforcing negative emotions and hindering motivation. Depression often correlates with other mental health concerns, such as stress, anxiety, and loneliness, creating a complex web of interconnected challenges that impact one’s well-being.

Depression and stress often intertwine, amplifying each other’s impact on mental well-being. Stressful life events can trigger or worsen depressive episodes, while depression can heighten an individual’s vulnerability to stress. Breaking this cycle requires recognizing the interplay between depression and stress, working to remove or reduce stressful triggers, and seeking support when needed.

Depression and anxiety frequently coexist, intensifying emotional distress and intertwining their symptoms. Anxiety can fuel restlessness, excessive worry, and a constant sense of unease, further burdening individuals with depression. Conversely, depression can give rise to fear, agitation, and an overwhelming sense of dread. Addressing both conditions may involve a comprehensive approach that combines therapy, medication, self-care practices, and social support.

Depression and loneliness often go hand in hand. Persistent sadness and loss of interest can make it challenging to connect with others, leading individuals with depression to withdraw from social interactions. This withdrawal exacerbates feelings of loneliness, creating a vicious cycle. Recognizing the impact of loneliness on depression and fostering social connections and support systems is crucial for promoting well-being and recovery.
• Why do people get depressed?

 People can get depressed due to a combination of various factors, including genetic predisposition, chemical imbalances in the brain, life events or trauma, chronic stress, and certain medical conditions.
• Why does my depression come and go?

 Depression can come and go due to its cyclical nature. Some individuals may experience episodes of depression followed by periods of remission, while others may have chronic or recurring depression. Factors such as stress, life events, lack of self-care, or inadequate treatment can contribute to the fluctuating nature of depression.
• Can you self diagnose depression?

 While it’s important to be aware of your mental health and seek professional help, self-diagnosing depression is not recommended. A proper diagnosis involves a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional who can assess your symptoms, medical history, and provide an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.
• Why does depression make you tired?

 Depression can make you feel tired due to disruptions in sleep patterns, changes in brain chemistry, and a lack of motivation or energy that often accompanies the condition. The emotional burden of depression can also contribute to fatigue and a sense of heaviness or lethargy.
• Does depression last forever?

 Depression does not necessarily last forever. It can vary in duration and intensity from person to person. With appropriate treatment, support, and self-care strategies, many individuals can experience relief from depressive symptoms and achieve recovery. It’s important to seek professional help to explore treatment options.
• Can you recover from depression?

 Yes, it is possible to recover from depression. Recovery may involve a combination of treatments, such as therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, and social support. It’s a journey that takes time and effort, but many individuals have successfully overcome depression and regained their sense of well-being.
• Does it get better?

 While everyone’s experience is unique, for many people, things do get better with proper support and treatment. Recovery from depression is possible, and individuals often find relief from symptoms and regain a sense of hope, joy, and overall well-being. It’s important to reach out for help and surround yourself with a supportive network of professionals and loved ones.
• None Major Depression: According to the National Institute of Mental Health, Major Depression is the most common type of depression. Usually, it is two or more weeks of depression symptoms like feelings of worthlessness, feelings of guilt, and a lack of interest in things you used to love.
• None Bipolar Disorder: Bipolar Disorder is not the same as depression. However, it often includes symptoms of depression—one’s mood will swing from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows.
• None Postpartum Depression: Having a baby can change the hormones in one’s body. Sometimes, this hormonal change can trigger symptoms of depression. About 16% of mothers will experience postpartum depression within a year of childbirth.
• None Premenstrual Dysmorphic Disorder (PMDD): Hormonal changes can be a wild ride for your brain and your body. PMDD is a type of depression that affects women during their period. It includes symptoms that are more severe than your usual PMS.
• None Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD): Sometimes, people can experience depression around major changes in seasons. Usually, people experience SAD during the winter when the weather is cold and the days creep shorter. Often, SAD improves with the next change in seasons. That doesn’t mean you need to wait it out to get help. Reach out to your doctor. And, of course, send us a text, too.

There are a few key symptoms that could indicate you are experiencing far more than your average bummer. Depressed thoughts, certain lifestyle changes, and physical symptoms can all be indicators of depression. It’s important to recognize these symptoms so that you or your loved one in need can seek help. Read on for a detailed breakdown of what each of these signs might look like.

Depressive thoughts can cast a shadow over our minds, distorting our perceptions and impacting our emotional well-being. They can make us feel disconnected from ourselves, hinder our productivity, and create a profound sense of despair. Here are some common experiences related to depressive thoughts:
• None I’m not feeling like myself: Depression can create a profound sense of disconnection from one’s own identity. It may feel as if you have lost touch with who you truly are, leading to a loss of self-esteem and a diminished sense of purpose.
• None Depression can greatly affect one’s ability to function in daily life, including work or other responsibilities. The overwhelming sadness, lack of motivation, and difficulty concentrating can make it challenging to perform tasks and meet deadlines.
• I feel depressed about life : Depression often brings about a pervasive feeling of hopelessness and despair about life in general. It can create a negative lens through which you view your circumstances, leading to a sense of bleakness and a loss of interest in the future.
• I feel like nothing matters : Depression can distort your perception of the world, making everything seem meaningless or futile. It may feel as if nothing you do has significance or brings any real joy, leading to a profound sense of apathy and indifference.

Depression can significantly impact our daily lives, making even the simplest tasks feel overwhelming and unachievable. It can manifest in various ways, leading to lifestyle changes that may disrupt our routines and social interactions. Here are some common experiences related to lifestyle changes in depression:
• Can’t get out of bed: One of the hallmark symptoms of depression is a lack of energy and motivation, which can make it difficult to find the strength to get out of bed in the morning. The heaviness and fatigue associated with depression can make staying in bed feel like the only option.
• Can’t shower: Depression can affect personal hygiene, leading to a loss of interest or motivation to engage in self-care activities such as showering or grooming. The lack of energy and low self-esteem can contribute to neglecting these basic self-care routines.
• Can’t get out of your own head: Depression often leads to intrusive and negative thoughts that can consume one’s mind. This can make it challenging to focus on external tasks or engage in activities without being preoccupied by the internal turmoil and self-critical thinking.
• No motivation to see friends or go out: Social withdrawal is a common consequence of depression. The feelings of sadness, emptiness, and low self-worth can diminish the desire to interact with others. People with depression often struggle with finding the motivation or energy to engage in social activities, preferring to isolate themselves instead.
• Difficulty making decisions: Depression can cloud one’s ability to make decisions, even simple ones. The overwhelming feelings of sadness and lack of motivation can make it difficult to weigh options, leading to indecisiveness or avoidance of decision-making altogether.

Depression doesn’t just affect emotional well-being. It can actually make you physically ill. It may start with subtle body language changes. This body language of depression is sometimes characterized by slumped posture, lack of eye contact, slow movements, and a general sense of lethargy. Facial expressions might appear sad or vacant, and the voice may sound flat or lacking in energy. It’s crucial to be attentive to these non-verbal cues as they can offer insights into someone’s emotional state and indicate the need for support and understanding. The following are some of the other physical symptoms to look out for:
• Chronic fatigue or insomnia: Depression can disrupt sleep patterns, leading to persistent fatigue or difficulty falling asleep (insomnia). People with depression may find it hard to wake up in the morning, even after a full night’s sleep, or they may struggle with staying asleep throughout the night.
• Appetite changes: Depression can affect appetite, leading to a decrease in hunger or interest in food, or conversely an over-reliance on food as a coping mechanism. Weight loss or changes in eating patterns, such as skipping meals, can occur. However, it’s important to note that some individuals may also experience increased appetite and weight gain as a response to depression.
• Physical aches and pains: Depression can manifest as physical sensations of pain, even in the absence of any specific medical condition. Individuals may experience persistent headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, or overall bodily discomfort.
• Digestive issues: Depression can also affect the gastrointestinal system, leading to symptoms such as stomachaches, indigestion, bloating, or changes in bathroom habits. These digestive disturbances can contribute to a sense of discomfort and overall physical distress.

Living with depression can be a sporadic journey, with some experiencing intermittent bouts while others face a lifetime struggle. Adaptation becomes a crucial aspect of coping with depression, as individuals learn to navigate and manage their emotions. Here are some common strategies and methods that people find helpful in working through depressive episodes:
• Develop coping skills for depression: Developing coping skills tailored to your needs can provide valuable tools for managing depressive episodes. This might include practicing mindfulness or meditation, engaging in creative outlets like art or writing, participating in physical activities, or finding solace in nature.
• Self-care for depression: Prioritizing self-care is essential when dealing with depression. Taking care of your physical and emotional well-being can help alleviate symptoms. This may involve establishing a consistent sleep routine, treating yourself to an at-home spa day, eating balanced meals, engaging in activities that bring joy, setting boundaries, and seeking support from loved ones.
• How to get out of bed when depressed: Getting out of bed can be a daunting task when you’re feeling depressed, but small steps can make a difference. Start by setting achievable goals, such as getting out of bed for a few minutes and opening the curtains to let in natural light.
• Things to do when depressed: Engaging in activities that provide a sense of fulfillment and distraction can help combat the weight of depression. It could be as simple as going for a walk, listening to a podcast, trying out a new hobby or creative outlet, watching a movie or TV show that brings joy, connecting with a friend or loved one, or practicing relaxation techniques.
• How to motivate yourself when you are depressed: Motivation can be a challenge in depression, but gentle encouragement and self-compassion can help. Break tasks into smaller, manageable steps, set realistic goals, and give yourself credit for even the smallest accomplishments. Surround yourself with positive influences, seek inspiration from uplifting books or podcasts, and remind yourself that progress takes time.
• Let someone in: When you’re depressed, likely the last thing you want to do is spend time with other humans. In reality, science says maintaining key aspects of your social life can be a powerful way to manage your depression. Try letting even one friend in and telling them what’s going on. Need a place to start? Try sending them a text like this: “Hey, I’m having a hard time and could use some company. Want to hang out?”
• Talk to a pro: Mental health is health. Sometimes it requires doctors to help you figure out the best plan for you. It’s never too early to ask for help. Getting help from a pro could help you unlock the tools to get out of a dark place.
• Talk to someone about depression at Crisis Text Line: Getting vulnerable about what is going on in your life is the ultimate sign of bravery. We’re ready to be brave with you.

Treating depression often involves seeking professional help from medical experts who specialize in mental health. These professionals play essential roles in providing guidance, support, and appropriate treatment options. If you have asked yourself, “Who can I talk to about depression?” or wondered, “What does a psychiatrist do?” we’re here to help answer your questions. Here are some insights into how doctors, therapists, and psychiatrists may approach treating depression:
• Talking to a Doctor about depression: Your primary care physician can be a good starting point when seeking help for depression. They can assess your symptoms, conduct necessary tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and provide initial guidance. They may also prescribe medications or refer you to a mental health specialist for further evaluation and treatment.
• Working with a Therapist to address depression: Working with a therapist, such as a psychologist or licensed counselor, can be instrumental in managing depression. Therapy provides a safe and supportive space to explore and address underlying emotional issues, learn coping strategies, and develop healthier thought patterns and behaviors. Therapists may utilize various therapeutic approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), or psychodynamic therapy, tailored to your specific needs.
• Working with a Psychiatrist to treat depression: Psychiatrists are medical doctors who specialize in mental health disorders. They can diagnose depression, prescribe medications if necessary, and provide comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and treatment. Psychiatrists often work in collaboration with therapists to offer a holistic approach to managing depression, combining medication management with therapy to address both the biological and psychological aspects of the condition.

It’s important to communicate openly and honestly with your healthcare professionals about your symptoms, concerns, and treatment preferences. They are trained to listen, provide guidance, and work with you to develop an individualized treatment plan. Remember that the journey to treating depression is unique for each person and finding the right combination of professionals and treatment modalities may take time. Seeking professional help is a crucial step towards finding the support and resources needed to work through depression.

Suicide is a leading cause of death. It’s also preventable. So, let’s take a moment to check-in. If you feel like ending your life, it’s brave to ask for help managing your emotions. You are valuable. You are important. And, the world needs you.

How to Get Help If You’re Thinking About Ending Your Life

First thing’s first: you matter. You are important. You bring light into this world. It’s okay to ask for help. And, we’re here for you.

Here are a few ways to get through the next second, minute, hour, and even a whole day.
• None Text us. We’re here for you—always. Text HOME to 741741 to connect with a real human. No judgment. Just listening.
• None Tell a friend. No matter how alone you feel, know that there are so many people who want you in this world. Confiding in someone can help you build a support system for times when you are feeling in a really dark place. Nervous about reaching out? Start with a text message like this: “Hey there. I’m feeling really alone right now. Would you mind keeping me company?”
• None Distract yourself. Find even one thing that brings you joy. And, hold onto it. Maybe it’s listening to your favorite song (listening to music is one of the most common coping tools for our texters), or maybe it’s looking into the eyes of your sweet kid. Whatever it may be, find one thing to turn to when you feel in the darkest of places.
• None Talk to a pro. If you are thinking about ending your life, chances are you are dealing with really painful emotions. Nobody deserves to feel that way and we are so sorry you do. Reach out to a therapist who can help you work through and process your emotions in a healthy way.
• None Go somewhere safe. If you feel like you are a danger to yourself, go somewhere where you can get immediate mental health support like urgent care, an emergency room, or dial 911.

Sometimes, thoughts of suicide are the result of underlying mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression. And like any illness, mental illnesses have symptoms—warning signs that someone is feeling like ending their life. Make no mistake, though, not everyone who has a mental illness is suicidal. And, not everyone who contemplates suicide has a mental illness.

When someone is contemplating suicide, they may show changes in the way they act, think, or behave.

Suicidal Behavior: What People Contemplating Suicide Might Say

Someone with suicidal thoughts may talk about:
• None Having no reason to live
• None Being a burden to others
• None Suicidal Behavior: What People Contemplating Suicide Might Do

Someone actively contemplating suicide may act impulsively or recklessly. It might look like:
• None Drinking more alcohol and using drugs
• None Looking for ways to end their lives, including searching online for possible methods
• None Isolating themselves from family, friends, and loved ones
• None Sleeping too much or too little
• None Saying goodbye to others

Crisis Text Line is dedicated to ending suicide. We can help if you or someone you know is thinking about ending their life. Text a Crisis Counselor at 741741, or use the mobile text button below to text from your phone. We’re here to support you.

The world around us impacts how everyone thinks and behaves. As much as sometimes we all want to make a safe bubble, that is simply not possible. So, both external factors (like relationship challenges, work stress, or trauma) and internal factors (like trouble regulating and processing emotions) can increase the risk of suicide.

Some of the health factors that can leave a person at a higher suicide risk include mental and physical health conditions such as:
• None Chronic pain or other serious health condition

Several circumstances in a person’s world can increase their likelihood of a suicide attempt. These include:
• None Access to lethal means like guns or pills
• None Someone else’s suicide, a loved one or even a celebrity or character

Personal connections to suicide or trauma can greatly increase someone’s risk of suicide. Three key risk factors experts and mental health professionals look for are:

How You Can Prevent Suicide

So, suicide is preventable. But, how? With your help.

We all have our hard stuff. If you have a friend who is contemplating suicide, it’s undeniably hard—for them and for you. Sometimes, preventing suicide comes down to having tough conversations with the people who matter to you. So, let’s face this challenge head on—together.

Here are some tips for starting a conversation:
• Listen. The most important thing you can do is let the person know that you are available to listen and hear about what is going on in their brain without judgement.
• Ask how you can help. Give the power back to the person that’s struggling. Ask how you can be helpful, whether it’s sitting with them when they’re lonely or helping them choose a doctor.
• Keep it casual . This is a friend you care about, and we’re here to support. Follow our to guide you through the conversation. Grab a cup of coffee, invite them over for the best Netflix binge, or host a study date and mention that you’re concerned to begin the conversation. Totally cool. Totally casual.
• Let them open up at their pace. If they’re not ready to talk, let them know that you’re here to listen whenever they’re ready.
• Encourage them to reach out for help . We are here for everyone. Encourage them to text 741741 if they need help. You could even help them save the number in their phone for whenever they are in a hot moment. That way, even when you are not there, we can help them get to cool and calm.

There is support for everyone. There is support for you. We are all in this big, brave world together.


For some people, when depression and anxiety lead to a tornado of emotions, they turn to self-harm looking for a release. Self-harm and self-injury are any forms of hurting oneself on purpose. Usually, when people self-harm, they do not do so as a suicide attempt. Rather, they self-harm as a way to release painful emotions.

Self-harm can manifest differently for everyone. And, the ways people may self-harm extend far beyond the usual references to cutting in media. Simply, self-harm is anything and everything someone can do to purposely hurt their body.

Here are some of the most common types of self-injury:
• Carving words or symbols into the skin
• Hitting or punching oneself (including banging one’s head or other body parts against another surface)
• Piercing the skin with sharp objects such as hairpins

Stigma creates shame and embarrassment, making it hard for people who self-harm to get help. So, look out for yourself and for your pals. If you suspect that someone in your life is self-harming, here are some warning signs to keep top of mind:
• Wearing long sleeves or long pants, even in hot weather
• Saying that they feel helpless, hopeless, or worthless

Crisis Text Line can help you deal with self-harm. Text a Crisis Counselor at 741741, or use the mobile text button below.

How to Deal With Self-Harm

Emotions can be really painful sometimes. It’s totally normal to need ways to cope with and process the hard things in your life. If you are using self-harm to manage your emotions, we’re here for you. And, we want to help keep you safe.

Here are some ways to push through, process, and cope with your emotions.
• Text to cool down. If you’re dealing with painful emotions, we’re here to help. Shoot us a text to connect with a real human and strategize healthy coping mechanisms to manage your emotions. Text HOME to 741741 to connect with a real human.
• Get creative. Studies show that diving into making art can help people process emotions. So, next time you’re feeling like self-harming, grab your sharpie and doodle your worries away. A bonus: you can totally suck at it and still reap the same rewards.
• Find your zen. Keeping yourself safe from self-harming is all about finding healthy alternatives to work through the hard stuff. Researchers found taking time to re-center through meditation to be a powerful way to find your cool and calm. Try using an app like Headspace to get on the meditation bandwagon.
• Talk to a pro. Self-harm is serious. And, while the intention behind self-harm usually is not death, it can still be dangerous—both physically and emotionally. Talking to someone who can help you find alternatives is incredibly important. Of course, you can start by texting us. Also, consider telling someone you know who can help you connect with a professional.

Let’s start with this: everyone needs a way to cope with their emotions. People who self-harm have turned to hurting themselves as their coping mechanism to manage their emotions.

So, people might self-harm to:
• Distract themselves from their negative feelings
• Feel something physical, particularly if they are feeling numb
• Develop a sense of control over their lives
• Punish themselves for things they think they’ve done wrong
• Express emotions that they are otherwise embarrassed to show

Self-harm can be seriously dangerous—physically, emotionally, socially, all of it.
• A diminished sense of self, including feeling helpless or worthless
• Becoming ostracized from loved ones who may not understand
• Interpersonal difficulty from lying to others about injuries

A lot of people who self-harm do so because they are dealing with painful emotions. If this applies to you, hi—we believe in you and recognize your pain. Because painful emotions are at the root of self-harm, quite often recovering from self-harm involves addressing emotions.

Breaking away from the cycle of self-harm can feel like a huge climb. It involves breaking a habit that has once brought comfort from pain. But, it is not impossible. Here are some steps to set you up for success:
• Name your reason for hurting yourself and your reason for quitting. Ask yourself: “What do I feel before, during, and after self-injury? Which of those emotions do I actively seek out, and which are harmful?”
• Identify other ways of achieving the same result. For example, if you self-harm for the physical sensation, seek other ways of releasing endorphins, like exercise. For real, try throwing a few punches at a kickboxing class or tapping it back in a spin class with the *perfect* playlist. If you self-harm to express your emotions, practice expressing them in words by writing them down. Grab a pen and your favorite notebook, or start typing away in your notes app.
• Tackle the underlying emotions. Explore the feelings that lead you to want to hurt yourself. If it’s guilt, where is that guilt coming from? Maybe try finding a therapist—there are pros trained specifically to help with this.
• Tell someone you trust. Let a friend, family member, or trusted adult know what you’re going through and that you need their support. Opening up to people can be easier said than done. Here’s a place to start: “I’m having a hard time processing some painful emotions and I could use your support right now.”

Getting healthy—both in your brain and in your body—takes hard work. You got this. And, we believe in you.

At 18 years old, I had my suicide attempt. The attempt frightened me to the point that I realized I wanted more for myself in life, and I had to learn how to advocate for myself so I could finally begin my healing journey. Therapy, medications, support, writing, art, and a desire to keep fighting keep me stable and well.

Next month marks 10 years of me surviving that attempt.

I was diagnosed with depression as a teenager and later discovered as an adult that I also struggle with bipolar disorder. It used to be a delicate balance when the bipolar was unknown and I’d cycle back and forth between mania and depression. Today, I am comfortable in my state of euthymia – which is known in psychology as living in the middle ground between highs and lows with no mood disturbances.

Research shows that between 25% and 60% of people with bipolar disorder will attempt suicide at least once in their lives. We sufferers are a vulnerable population, so it’s important for us to know the warning signs, learn coping skills, and show ourselves deep compassion.

I still have blips of depressive episodes once or twice a year, but I have a wide array of therapeutic skills and support available to me, as well as a healing brain with a more developed prefrontal cortex. The suicidal ideation I experienced as a teenager was severe due to not having the proper diagnosis or adequate support. In my suicidal ideation, I never fully wanted to leave my life; I truly just wanted the pain to stop and to no longer feel like a burden – there is a distinction there.

I do everything within my power to be well, but sometimes triggers occur. During my last depressive episode last winter, the thought that repeated in my head constantly as a teenager reared its ugly face in my consciousness again: “I want to die.” While this thought was accompanied by a bottomless, hopeless sadness, I was able to come out of the darkness through self-compassion and reaching out to my people. My support network consists of my therapist, close friends, mentors, and family. I am also fortunate to have community at my fingertips with social media; I feel well connected in my life despite the struggles that arise. After reaching out and being reassured that I am not alone and that I am loved, I was able to feel like Lexie again.

That thought recently resurfaced. I experienced some losses, and to my dismay, “I want to die” popped into my head once again, unannounced and unwanted. I prepared myself for the agony, the keeling over in physical pain, and the perpetual sobbing from overwhelming emotional anguish. The pain did not come though. There was a pause within me upon hearing my inner monologue say it, but not a silence of desperation trying to conceal pain flowing from invisible wounds. Rather, there was a stillness of relief, and I became curious: “Why am I thinking that I want to die, but the old feelings aren’t accompanying the thought? This feels so different.” The trigger brought up a lot, but the redirection following the thought surprised and then comforted me. I also did not fall into a depressive episode this time.

Although the intrusive thought acted as the ingrained reflex, in this moment of clarity, I began supplying my brain with fact-checking. I was thinking about how I feel comfortable and confident in who I am. I feel appreciated in my professional and personal life. Those four words were once raising alarms in my brain, and now I can brush them off as the harmless remnants of ashes floating around after a winning battle. The fire of hope burns bright within me today. I want to be alive.

Many of us return to old pain in times of struggle to validate or just feel some semblance of safety. Self-harming behaviors were what I’d naturally curl up in whenever I felt hopeless. Being in recovery and having community now, I feel immense comfort in my peace and joy – it’s no wonder this resurfaced thought felt so foreign. It doesn’t serve me anymore.

We may have 60,000 thoughts a day, but not every thought is useful – or true. Seeing that phrase for what it was, one born from shame and sadness and not depressive darkness, I knew those emotions were natural and human. The thought may repeat, but the approach evolved.

I hope that if you have ever experienced similar depressive thoughts, that you also can experience relief from the heaviness of these words. Even amongst the sadness and pain, there are infinite beautiful things in this world – and you are included in that scope of beauty. We are worth the time it takes to heal.

Let us use National Suicide Prevention Month to remember those we have lost, remember those who have fought and continue to fight so very hard for inner peace today, and encourage those around us that life is worth living.

Suicide is when a teen causes his or her own death on purpose. Before trying to take their own life, a teen may have thoughts of wanting to die. This is called suicidal ideation. He or she may also have suicidal behavior. That’s when a teen is focused on doing things that cause his or her own death.

Suicide is the third leading cause of death in young people ages 15 to 24. The CDC reports that:
• None Boys are 4 times more likely to die from suicide than girls.
• None Girls are more likely to try to commit suicide than boys.
• None Guns are used in more than half of all youth suicides.

What causes a teen to attempt suicide?

The teen years are a stressful time. They are filled with major changes. These include body changes, changes in thoughts, and changes in feelings. Strong feelings of stress, confusion, fear, and doubt may affect a teen’s problem-solving and decision-making. He or she may also feel a pressure to succeed.

For some teens, normal developmental changes can be very unsettling when combined with other events, such as:
• None Changes in their families, such as divorce, siblings moving out, or moving to a new town

These problems may seem too hard or embarrassing to overcome. For some, suicide may seem like a solution.

Which teens are at risk for suicide?

A teen’s risk for suicide varies with age, gender, and cultural and social influences. Risk factors may change over time. They are:
• None One or more mental or substance abuse problems
• None Undesirable life events such as being bullied or recent losses, such as the death of a parent
• None Exposure to the suicidal behavior of others, such as from family or peers, in the news, or in fiction stories

What are the warning signs of teen suicide?

Many of the warning signs of suicide are also symptoms of depression. They are:
• None Changes in eating and sleeping habits
• None More physical complaints often linked to emotional distress, such as stomachaches, headaches, and extreme tiredness (fatigue)
• None Loss of interest in school or schoolwork
• None Feeling he or she wants to die

Another warning sign is making plans or efforts toward committing suicide:
• None Says “I want to kill myself,” or “I'm going to commit suicide.”
• None Gives verbal hints, such as “I won't be a problem much longer,” or “If anything happens to me, I want you to know ....”
• None Gives away favorite things or throws away important belongings
• None Becomes suddenly cheerful after being depressed

These warning signs may seem like other health problems. Have your teen see his or her healthcare provider for a diagnosis.

How is a teen diagnosed as being suicidal?

Threats of suicide are a cry for help. Always take such statements, thoughts, behaviors, or plans very seriously. Any teen who expresses thoughts of suicide should not be left alone and should be evaluated right away. Talk with your teen’s healthcare provider about suicide and have a written emergency plan.

Any teen who has tried to commit suicide needs a physical checkup first to rule out life-threatening health problems. He or she should then get a mental health evaluation and treatment until he or she is stable. This often will take place at an inpatient facility to make sure of the child’s safety.

How is a teen treated for suicidal behavior?

Treatment will depend on your child’s symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is.

Treatment starts with a detailed evaluation of events in your teen’s life during the 2 to 3 days before the suicidal behaviors. Treatment may include:
• None An extended hospital stay, if needed. This gives the child a supervised and safe environment.

How can I help prevent my teen from attempting suicide?

Learning the warning signs of teen suicide can prevent an attempt. Keeping open communication with your teen and his or her friends gives you a chance to help when needed. Also take these steps:
• None Keep medicines and guns away from children and teens.
• None Get your teen help for any mental or substance abuse problems.
• None Support your teen. Listen, try not to offer undue criticism, and stay connected.
• None Become informed about teen suicide. Resources include the public library, local support groups, and the Internet.
• None Know the warning signs for depression:
• None Loss of interest in social and sports activities
• None Sleeping too little or too much
• None Changes in weight or appetite

Teens can take these steps to help prevent suicide if they see warning signs in a friend:
• None Take their friend’s behavior and talk of suicide seriously.
• None Encourage their friend to seek expert help. Go with the friend, if needed.
• None Talk right away with an adult they trust about their friend.

When should I call my teen’s healthcare provider?

Call your teen’s healthcare provider right away if your teen:
• None Feels extreme depression, fear, anxiety, or anger toward him or herself or others
• None Sees things that others don’t see
• None Can’t sleep or eat for 3 days in a row
• None Shows behavior that concerns friends, family, or teachers, and others express concern about this behavior and ask you to seek help

Call 911 if your teen has suicidal thoughts, a suicide plan, and the means to carry out the plan.
• None Suicide is when a teen causes his or her own death on purpose.
• None Suicidal ideation is when a teen has thoughts of wanting to die.
• None Suicidal behavior is when a teen is focused on doing things that cause his or her own death.
• None Normal developmental changes combined with stressful life events may cause a teen to think about suicide.
• None Many of the warning signs of suicide are also symptoms of depression.
• None Any teen who expresses suicidal thoughts should not be left alone and should be evaluated right away.

Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your child’s healthcare provider:
• None Know the reason for the visit and what you want to happen.
• None Before your visit, write down questions you want answered.
• None At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you for your child.
• None Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed and how it will help your child. Also know what the side effects are.
• None Ask if your child’s condition can be treated in other ways.
• None Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean.
• None Know what to expect if your child does not take the medicine or have the test or procedure.
• None If your child has a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.
• None Know how you can contact your child’s provider after office hours. This is important if your child becomes ill and you have questions or need advice.

Suicide is the second leading cause of death – following motor vehicle accidents – among teenagers and young adults. On average, adolescents aged 10 to 19 years have an annual suicide rate of about 5 to 8 people for every 100,000 people. LGBTQ youth are more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual and cisgender peers. Suicide rates are higher among Indigenous teens compared to those from other backgrounds.

 The teen years are an anxious and unsettling period as youths face the difficulties of transition into adulthood. It is a period in life that is often confusing, leaving teens feeling isolated from family or peers.

Unfortunately, some may at one point or another perceive suicide as a permanent answer to problems that are more often than not just temporary. The self doubts, confusion, and pressures to succeed or conform can come at a high price for troubled adolescents.

Girls generally attempt suicide more often than boys, but boys are about 3 times more likely to die from the suicide attempt. This is because the methods that boys choose – often using firearms or hanging – are more lethal than those chosen by girls, namely drug overdoses or cutting themselves.

Many troubling and difficult situations can make a teen consider suicide. The same emotional states that make adults vulnerable to considering suicide also apply to adolescents. Those with good support networks (e.g., among family and peers, or extracurricular sport, social, or religious associations) are likely to have an outlet to help them deal with their feelings. Others without such networks are more susceptible during their emotional changes, and may feel that they're all alone in times of trouble.

Apart from the normal pressures of teen life, specific circumstances can contribute to an adolescent's consideration of suicide. It's especially difficult when adolescents are confronted with problems that are out of their control, such as:

Many suicides are committed by people who are depressed. Depression is a mental health disorder. It causes chemical imbalances in the brain, which can lead to despondency, lethargy, or general apathy towards life. About one tenth of 15 to 24-year-olds in Canada could be diagnosed with depression, which makes coping with the extensive stresses of adolescence all the more difficult. Symptoms of depression in youth are often overlooked or passed off as being typical "adolescent turmoil."

Another serious problem that can lead teens to suicide – or aid in their plans to end their lives – is the easy access many of them have to firearms, drugs, alcohol, and motor vehicles. For the general population, about 30% of suicides involve firearms. Of all firearm-related deaths that occur, about 80% are suicides.

Suicidal tendencies don't just appear out of the blue: people usually display a number of warning signs when things seem so wrong in their lives that they've simply given up hope. Because adolescence is such a turbulent time, it may be difficult to distinguish the signs that lead to suicide from the changing, sometimes uncertain but otherwise normal behaviour of teens.

Behaviour changes to watch for are:
• changes in eating patterns, such as sudden weight loss or gain
• symptoms that are often related to emotional state (e.g., headaches, fatigue, stomach aches)
• loss of ability to tolerate praise or rewards

Though many suicidal teens appear depressed or downcast, others hide their problems underneath a disguise of excess energy. If an adolescent starts displaying uncharacteristic agitation and hyperactivity, it may also signal the existence of an underlying problem. This restlessness may take the form of confrontational or aggressive behaviour.

More obvious signs that an adolescent may be suicidal include low self-esteem and self-deprecating remarks. Some teens come right out and talk or write about their suicidal thoughts – this should be taken seriously, and not ignored with the hope that it's a passing phase. Any previous attempts at suicide are loud and clear cries for help, which demand responses before it's too late.

It's essential that you take suicidal behaviour or previous attempts seriously – and get assistance quickly. Aside from professional treatment, a suicidal teen needs to know there are people who care, and who are available to talk to. Good support means listening to what's troubling somebody without passing judgment on his or her feelings. A person should be reassured that there are always solutions to problems or ways other than suicide for coping with them. Giving an adolescent the chance to open up and talk about his or her feelings will help relieve some of the distress of those intense emotions, and make that person feel less alone.

Don't hesitate to bring up the subject of suicide, and to ask direct questions. Somebody who hasn't considered ending their life isn't going to adopt the idea simply because the possibility has been raised. On the other hand, for individuals who are thinking about suicide, your concern will only be reassuring. At the same time, people can take the opportunity to open up about their distress.

Some parents may find that their adolescent child resists their advances and isn't willing to confide in them. When teens insist their parents just "don't understand," it might be a good idea to suggest they talk to a more objective or emotionally neutral person. This can include other family members, religious leaders, a school counsellor, a coach, or a trusted doctor.

Restricting access to firearms and ammunition is also an important preventive measure. Weapons kept in the home increase the risk that suicide attempts will be successful, by giving a suicidal adolescent the means to take their own life.

It is very important to seek professional help for the adolescent who may be suicidal. Guidance counsellors at schools or counsellors at crisis centres can help ensure that a distressed teen receives the needed assistance.

As the vast majority of adolescents who commit suicide have depressive symptoms, recognition and evaluation of clinical depression – a treatable medical condition – is essential. Physicians, including psychiatrists, provide both one-on-one counselling and medical treatment for the biochemical causes of depression.

Psychological counselling will help a teen develop effective mechanisms for coping with problems. These will be of value long after adolescence has ended, when a person has to face many of the stresses routinely encountered during adulthood.

Information for telephone counselling and suicide hotline services, available in most cities and regions, can be found in the telephone book and online. They offer counselling for a crisis situation, and can provide the immediate support an adolescent may need to survive a low point.

Another place to go during a crisis or in a suicidal state is the emergency ward of a hospital. Receiving the aid of trained professionals will help an adolescent deal with the emotional roller coaster that often leads to suicide. Short-term and long-term care can minimize the risk of committing suicide and help people find alternative solutions to coping with extreme distress.

As children grow and become more independent, it can be more challenging for parents to know what they are thinking and feeling. When do the normal ups and downs of adolescence become something to worry about?

Parents and family members can help teens cope when life feels too difficult to bear. Learn about factors that can increase your child's risk for suicide and explore these 12 suggestions below. These steps can help you feel better prepared to offer the caring, non-judgmental support your child needs.



1. If you see signs that your child's mental health is under threat, tune in.

Maybe your child is just having a bad day. When signs of mental health troubles last for weeks, though, don't assume it's just a passing mood.

Studies show that 9 of 10 teens who died by suicide were struggling with mental health conditions such as depression. But keep in mind:
• None Teens who haven't been diagnosed with any mental health condition may still be at risk. In part, this is because it can be hard to pinpoint mental health issues at early ages.
• None Occasionally teens who attempt suicide do not have underlying mental health issues. But they may give signs that they're considering ending their own lives.

Your goal should be to remain calm, alert and ready to speak with your teen. Don't wait for them to come to you. You might start by saying, "You seem sad. I'm open to talking about this, because I love you and I care what happens to you."

Here are more tips for opening mental health conversations with your child.

2. Listen—even when your child is not talking.



Don't be surprised if your teen turns away when you first raise the subject of mental health or suicide. Keep in mind that, even if your child is silent at first, actions may speak even more loudly than words.

Watch for major changes in your child's sleep patterns, appetite and social activities. Self-isolation, especially for kids who usually enjoy hanging out with friends or participating in activities, can signal serious difficulties.

If your child is struggling more than usual with schoolwork, chores and other responsibilities, these are additional signs you shouldn't ignore.

3. Realize that your child might be facing suicide risks you haven't considered yet.



Many parents wonder: Could my child really be at risk for suicide? Unfortunately, the answer is yes. Young people of all races, ethnicities, gender identities, sexual orientations, income levels and community backgrounds die by suicide every year.

In fact, suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people 10 to 24 years old.

Here are some suicide risk factors to be aware of:
• None Loss of a loved one to death, divorce, deployment, deportation or incarceration
• None Discrimination, rejection or hostility due to gender identity or sexual orientation
• None Stigma (the belief that it's wrong or shameful to talk about mental health or suicide)
• None Financial instability that causes worry and insecurity
• None Suicide in their school or friend group
• None Major life-changing events, such as a breakup with a dating partner, a change in social connections, academic disappointment or a major health issue



Get more perspective on your child's specific risks here.

4. Do not dismiss what you're seeing as "teenage drama."



Never assume your child is exaggerating or playing games if they say or write:
• None "I wonder how many people would come to my funeral?"
• None "Sometimes I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up."
• None "Everyone would be better off without me."
• None "You won't have to worry about me much longer."

Many adolescents who attempt suicide will tell their parents ahead of time (though others do not). These words indicate an urgent need for help.

Don't risk being wrong about this. Take every statement about suicide seriously.



When your child talks or writes about suicide, you may feel shocked, hurt or angry. You may even want to deny what you're seeing or argue with your child. These feelings are natural and valid. But it's essential to focus on your child's needs first and foremost.

Your goal is to create a safe space where your teen can trust you to listen and express concern, but without judgment or blame. 



Instead of reacting this way:
• None "That's a ridiculous thing to say."
• None "You have a great life – why would you end it?"
• None "You don't mean that."
• None "I can't believe what I'm hearing!"

Manage your own feelings so you can respond with empathy:
• None "I'm sorry you are feeling this way—can you share a bit more?"
• None "It sounds like you're in tremendous pain and you can't see a way out."
• None "Maybe you're wondering how life got this complicated and difficult."
• None "Right now, you're not sure of the answers to the problems you're facing."
• None "You must really, really be hurting inside to consider ending your life."

6. Get help right away.

Risk for suicidal behavior is complex and not straightforward. Certainly, if you are concerned about depression, self-harm or vague references to suicide thoughts, seek care from your primary care provider as soon as possible. You can consider reaching out to a school therapist, local mental health provider or even a national suicide hotline for guidance.



If you have any concern that your teen is at more immediate risk for attempting suicide, take them to the emergency department of your local hospital or call 911. Fast action is crucial when things have reached a crisis point.

Health care providers can help you and your teen create a safety plan that covers:
• None Warning signs or triggers your teen feels will lead to suicidal thoughts
• None Possible steps to help them cope when they feel triggered
• None Sources of support: family, friends, teachers, mentors and others
• None Emergency contacts and steps to take if things get worse

7. Remove or secure guns you have at home. Do the same with other lethal means.



Half of youth suicides occur with firearms—and suicide attempts with firearms are almost always fatal. Teens and adolescents almost always use a gun found in their house.
• By far, the safest option is to remove all guns and ammunition from your home while your teen is struggling with thoughts of suicide. Many families turn guns over to relatives (as long as your child does not go to that relative's house), other trusted individuals, law enforcement or gun shops to help safeguard their teen during a vulnerable time.
• Safe home storage is the second-best option. Locking and unloading all guns, with ammunition stored and locked in a separate space, does reduce the risk of tragedy. But it only helps if your teen doesn't know the combination to the lock or where the key is hidden. Disassembling guns and storing the components separately and locked is another option.

Of course, guns are not the only means of suicide your child might seek out. Prescription medications and over-the-counter drugs can pose hazards during a suicidal crisis.

Keep medications locked away and, whenever possible, reduce the volume of medications on hand. Also consider buying over-the-counter medications in blister packs instead of bottles. This can help slow down access to pills.

Hanging/suffocation is another leading way adolescents die by suicide. Though it is challenging to completely eliminate this possibility, secure any ropes, belts, cords or plastic bags so teens do not have access.

Other potentially lethal tools and substances you should consider locking away include:



The work of removing or locking up these objects and substances may seem daunting. But remember that your child's safety is at stake.

8. As your child enters treatment, focus on creating hope.



Your child's care team will likely recommend a combination of steps to reduce mental health symptoms and thoughts of suicide. Medications, talk therapy and stress-reducing techniques such as yoga, meditation or journaling may be part of the plan.

Provide realistic reassurance for your child along the way. Remind them (and yourself) that difficult times don't last forever. People do feel better when they receive effective treatment and support.

If your child expresses feelings of stigma or shame, you can remind them that 1 in 5 people have mental health symptoms at some point in their lives. Mental health is part of total health—and seeking help is a sign of self-respect and maturity.

9. Encourage them to see family and friends, and keep an eye on social media.



Your child may feel reluctant to spend time with other people. However, you can explain that social support, when they are ready, may help them feel better.

Although more quiet time might be needed at first, gentle encouragement to hang out with family, friends and neighbors will be helpful. Avoid power struggles around specific events or invitations, since your goal is to respect your child's needs and minimize stress.

Social media may be the primary way some adolescents engage with their friends. It can be a point of connection and support, but at the same time, social media can be a source of bullying and triggers. Encourage an open dialogue around social media use and ask how your adolescent feels after using social media. Consider making a Family Media Plan.

Sleep changes can be warning signs before suicidal thoughts. In addition, sleep is important for baseline mental health. Encourage healthy sleep habits.

Physical activity eases mental health symptoms and supports your child's wellness plan. Whether it's getting outside to take a daily walk, a gym workout, an online exercise class or something else, exercise will:
• None Elevate your teen's mood by stimulating the production of endorphins (natural substances in the brain and body that help balance out stress and manage pain).
• None Support higher levels of serotonin, another brain-body substance that leads to positive moods and restful sleep.

Offer to go with them on a walk, a bike ride, or to the gym. Experts recommend 60 minutes of physical activity per day for adolescents. Easing back into any form of exercise is fine. What matters most is that your teen enjoys this activity and feels motivated to do it regularly.

Teens in crisis need to go easy on themselves. This means adopting a realistic pace and avoiding experiences that could prove overwhelming.

Reassure your teen that self-care is never a sign of weakness. Everything we do in life is affected by our health. So, giving ourselves time to heal is essential. Big tasks can be divided into smaller, more manageable ones, and gradually, as your child's confidence and strength grows, they'll feel ready to take on more.



12. Remind each other that this will take time.



You and your child will benefit from knowing that progress will come at its own pace. Setbacks may happen—they're part of the healing process, too.

Encourage your child to be patient and self-forgiving. They've been through a lot, but with the right care and support, you will both see improvement.

If your child is considering suicide, call or text 988 or chat on 988lifeline.org right away. The Lifeline provides 24/7, free and confidential support for people in distress, prevention and crisis resources for you or your loved ones.

Ask your teen's care team for other resources you should know about. The National Alliance on Mental Illness and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention have great information.

Parents of LGBTQ2S+ children can visit the Trevor Project website for focused resources. Parents and teens facing racial stress can benefit from these strategies and tools offered by the American Psychological Association.

Teenage trauma is currently prevalent in American society. A recent study indicated that 65% of the surveyed teens had experienced at least one traumatic event. And, for parents and caregivers, the effects of teen trauma are shocking to experience. You want to protect your children and ensure their happiness and safety. No parent wants to see their child suffer. If your teen has been suffering trauma in the past, we’re here to help.

What Causes Traumatic Stress In Adolescents?

When we talk about teenage traumatic stress, we’re referring to a combined emotional and physical response to an event that has caused your teen to feel overwhelmingly terrorized, horrified, and helpless. This might trigger several physiological reactions in the teen, including nausea, dry mouth, heart palpitations, incontinence, and dizziness.

Events that might cause teen trauma include:
• Traumatic loss or grief (e.g., the death of a sibling or parent)
• Interpersonal victimization or violence like assault and rape

However, some distressing events don’t result in traumatic stress, because some teens cope differently with events.

Types Of Trauma Your Teens Might Experience

Trauma is divided into two distinct categories: chronic and acute.
• Chronic trauma happens when your teen is a victim or a witness to ongoing, painful experiences and repeated assaults. Teens experiencing persistent traumatic events are likely to turn to alcohol or drugs to calm anxiousness and negative thoughts. Ongoing emotional or physical abuse, domestic violence, bullying, and instabilities at home are examples of chronic trauma. Witnessing a loved one being molested, like a sibling or parent in a domestic violence situation, is an example of chronic trauma, too.
• Acute trauma is a situation that typically occurs quickly and at one time and leaves a lasting impact. Experiencing a personal injury from a car accident, witnessing an assault or injury, and being sexually assaulted or threatened causes acute trauma.

Teens react differently to trauma. There’re many ways they experience sorrowful reactions to a traumatic event. A reaction might become unhealthy if the mood or behavior is prolonged and affect your teen’s lifestyle. Some of the signs of psychological and emotional trauma include:

Painful, extreme, and frightening events create natural physiological reactions to self-preservation. This is characterized by heightened emotional and physical responses, ranging from feelings of intense fear to a rapid heart rate. Also, unresolved trauma can progress into Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

The body might naturally work through such responses and resume normality in some situations. But, sometimes, the body and mind might continue to react as if the events are repeatedly occurring in response to the trigger or sometimes with no detectable external trigger.

Seeking Help For Teen PTSD and Trauma

At Teensavers, we understand that trauma in the teenage years should be treated immediately and effectively. So, we conduct a comprehensive assessment to diagnose PTSD and other co-occurring disorders. Therapy produces the most significant outcomes in trauma treatment.

Therapists use various modalities in the healing process. Teens react differently to traumatic events, so therapies are unique, too. The most popular and useful modalities in the treatment of teen trauma and PTSD include;
• Experimental therapies like art therapy, adventure therapy, music therapy, and Equine-Assisted Therapy allow transformation and growth through hands-on, real-life experiences that build self-confidence and trust.
• Somatic body therapy helps teenagers to release trauma and bring the nervous system to balance.
• Dialectical behavioral therapy teaches various skills that allow your teen to become self-aware and effectively manage difficult emotions and feelings.
• Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy identifies the thought process related to trauma and helps teens reframe their experience.

If something seems out of character, it might be the time to get them assisted. Teensavers is available to help with any questions you might have. Our programs treat substance abuse, teen PTSD, trauma, and other underlying mental health issues. If you’re unsure of what to do about your traumatized teen, give us a call anytime at 714-288-9779.


A study of close to 7,500 high school students across the country who reported experiencing different suicidal behaviors finds that more than one-third of them have attempted suicide.

The research, by the University of Washington and New York University, explored gender, racial and ethnic differences among those who think about and/or attempt suicide, as well as associated behavioral and environmental factors.

Researchers found that Black high school students are almost twice as likely as white students to attempt suicide without reporting any thoughts or plans. And students across racial and ethnic groups who reported certain factors or behaviors — being bullied online, feeling sad or hopeless, a history of sexual violence, smoking cigarettes or misusing prescription opiates — were more likely to report thinking about, planning and attempting suicide, as opposed to having thoughts and plans without an attempt.

The study, published online Sept. 4 in Prevention Science, included data from nearly 7,500 high school students around the country who completed the National Youth Risk Behavior surveys in 2015, 2017 or 2019 and who reported having suicidal thoughts, a suicide plan and/or a suicide attempt within the past 12 months.

Other research has tended to merge youth who think about suicide into one group with youth who have attempted suicide and focus on the differences between this group and youth who have no history of suicidal behaviors. What makes this study different, said lead author Meghan Romanelli, an assistant professor of social work at the UW, is that it identifies distinct patterns of thought, plans and attempts among adolescents, ranging from those who think about suicide (known as “suicidal ideation”) but don’t attempt it, to those who attempt it without any evidence of thoughts or plans.

“Most adolescents who think about suicide don’t go on to attempt it, so in the analysis we wanted to separate out adolescents attempted suicide from those who thought about suicide but did not attempt in order to identify what factors may have put youth at higher risk,” Romanelli said. “These differences are important because it allows us to deploy prevention and intervention efforts that are targeted to the adolescent’s level of risk.”

More than 44,000 young people responded to the national surveys, which were administered in traditional public high schools. Researchers then focused on the nearly 7,500 respondents who expressed some degree of suicidal thoughts, plans or attempts and found that 3% reported attempting suicide without thoughts or plans. About one-fourth of the 7,500 respondents said they’d only thought about suicide; 38% said they’d planned suicide but did not attempt it, and 35% said they’d thought about, planned and attempted suicide.
• Young men, in general, were more likely to report attempting suicide without thoughts or plans. Previous research has found lower rates of mental health diagnoses among young men, and suggests socialization to conceal feelings of sadness and hopelessness may be a factor.
• Feelings of sadness and hopelessness were common, in general, among young people who thought about suicide or had attempted suicide with thoughts and plans. Those feelings were less common, however, among those who attempted suicide without reported thoughts or plans.
• Hispanic/Latino youth were 1.6 times more likely to report a suicide attempt with thoughts and plans as opposed to having suicidal thoughts only, and4 times more likely to report a suicide attempt with ideation rather than only having suicidal thoughts and plans. Black teens, who represented just over 10% of the total study sample, comprised more than 25% of the respondents who said they’d attempted suicide without thoughts or plans.

“What we’re seeing is that Black youth are more likely to evidence an attempt, seemingly without telling anyone about their thoughts and plans beforehand,” said Michael A. Lindsey, a study co-author who is executive director of the McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy and Research at NYU. The new study, Lindsey noted, supports his team’s prior research, which found that self-reported suicide attempts are increasing among Black youth, while self-reported thoughts and plans have been decreasing.

Suicide screening tools typically focus on explicit articulation of suicidal ideation or plans. This study, Romanelli said, can inform ways that such screening tools can be more nuanced, to capture behaviors.

“Current suicide screenings often mark suicidal thoughts and plans as primary indicators that a person might be at risk for an attempt. But youth might express symptoms in different ways,” Romanelli said.

For example, “Black youth’s symptoms may be more likely to manifest as concerns in their relationships with others, physical complaints or behavioral problems. Since suicide screening tools generally don’t consider these factors, it’s important that we start to think about these potentially different warning signs or expressions of suicidality among Black youth aside from thoughts and plans.”

It’s essential, Romanelli added, that clinicians build rapport and trust, and that they think about and understand the background and context of the youth in front of them.

The study was funded by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the National Institute of Mental Health.

Additional co-authors were Arielle Sheftall, of the Center for Suicide Prevention and Research at the Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio; Sireen B. Irsheid of the University of Chicago Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice; and Tracy M. Grogan of the NYU McSilver Institute.

Hello, this is How to Save Humanity in 17 Goals, a podcast brought to you by Nature Careers, in partnership with Nature Food.

I am Juliana Gil, chief editor at Nature Food. Welcome again to the series where we meet the scientists working towards the global development targets brokered by the United Nations.

In 2015, world leaders pledged to solve a range of economic, environmental and social issues. A package of 17 development goals were agreed upon.

Since then, in a huge effort, thousands of researchers all over the world have been tackling the biggest problems that the planet faces today.

In episode three, we look at Sustainable Development Goal number three: How to ensure health and well-being for all. And meet a psychiatrist who is determined to push mental health further up the agenda.

So my name is Shekhar Saxena. I am a psychiatrist by training, and have involvement in public mental health. Currently, I teach at Harvard Chan School of Public Health, at Harvard University.

Earlier, I worked at the World Health Organization for several years, and I was directing the department of mental health and substance abuse.

The Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations was actually a landmark achievement and an agreement of all countries, which was very much more advanced than the previous Millennium Development Goals. And I would refer to two reasons why I say it was a major change.

One is that SDGs apply to all countries, rather than only to the so-called developing countries.

And the second areas is that SDGs included, were many more than MDGs. So it was more comprehensive. And it was applicable to all countries.

And I’m very happy to say that SDG 3, which is about health and wellbeing, is a very progressive agreement of the countries. They really said that health is important for their development.

And the goal is healthy life and wellbeing, which will have a high degree for all the citizens.

So it was a landmark declaration by the counties. Human is just a conduit. It’s the countries that decided to do that.

And I'm also happy to see that mental health was explicitly included within SDG 3.

And it was an integral part of health. So yes, it was definitely a very progressive declaration and mental health attained a level of attention that perhaps was not there earlier.

I began my professional career as a psychiatrist, treating people who came to me one after another, 100 after another 100.

And that was very much in clinical practice where SDGs, which were not there at that time, were quite irrelevant. However, my profession transited to public mental health, where it was not about clinical practice. It was about population mental health.

And that's where the principles of health for all, and also community participation, and prevention and promotion became more important than just the treatment.

That was a nexus stage where I started working for WHO. The SDG era, which started in 2015, is a further transition where mental health is not only a part of health, but it's a part of development.

And that's what my work involves now. To see to it that mental health is given enough attention within the health agenda, but it is also given importance in the sustainable development agenda.

I should just say that having done clinical practice for two decades actually helped me a lot in my further work as a policy person.

Because when I look at policies now, when I advise about mental health policies to countries, I have those people in mind who I treated. The policy is to actually help real people in real places, and not on an abstract. Policy is a document that is written on paper, but it's supposed to help real people.

And that's what is lost many times. And I consciously try to keep that in mind, to see what could be the impact of the policies on people who I saw in Delhi, or I saw in Nigeria, in Lagos, or anywhere else, including in New York, actually.

And the policies need to be such that they help the people who are most in need, at the maximum. And that is what is important. The principle of equity, the principle of policy, serving everybody, and policy serving the largest number of people, rather than, very well, a small number of people.

The understanding of mental health has improved a lot. The awareness about mental health problems within the citizens has also improved a lot. The very frequent references to mental health in the media, in the conventional as well as social media, has increased enormously.

Now, we cannot go through a day without reading something about mental health in the media that we read. So understanding has increased, research has increased, awareness has increased.

What has actually not increased is the amount of resources that we spend on mental health. I should also say that COVID pandemic, which obviously killed a lot of people and affected a very large proportion of population in the world, was actually a net gain for mental health because it increased the awareness.

Of course, mental health problems increased. Quite substantially, actually. But the awareness and attention also increased a lot.

However, there is still a lack of human as well as financial resources that are devoted to mental health. You might be surprised to learn that, on an average, countries spend less than 2% of their health budget on mental health, when the burden is something like 10%. So there is a large gap between what is needed, and what is available for mental health.

So that is the number one problem for mental health in the world today. We lack trained people who can provide care. We lack policies which are conducive to better mental health for the population. And we need the financial resources to make that happen.

Having said that, and also having said that mental institution has actually improved not as much as the day and the progress is far too slow.

Let's take a couple of examples to illustrate. Suicide is one of the final and perhaps the most tragic outcome of mental health issues and conditions, not necessarily of mental disorders, but obviously of distress, which people face. And that is still a very large problem.

However, it is a public health problem. In the world currently, it's nearly 800,000 people who die because of suicide every year. And every death is far too many.

So this is a big problem. Although I should say that the overall suicide rate in the world has actually come down just a little bit.

So there is some progress that is taking place. But in many countries, suicide rate is high and is increasing. Let’s take the example of two large countries. One is India, where the official rate, official number of people who die because of suicide is about 170,000 per year, which is anyway large. But a fairly substantial number of suicides are not reported because of the stigma and because of the legal issues and other issues. So the unofficial numbers are perhaps much larger than that.

And actually, it has been said that India has about one third of all completed suicides in the world, which is so large and is increasing.

What is even more troubling is that some of the most vulnerable groups in India have shown the largest increase in the suicide rate, which of course, includes the poor, but also suicides among women, and amongst young people are increasing a lot.

And that is something which is extremely tragic in a country like India, which is, which is developing, actually developing as opposed to many other countries who are not developing.

This is a very sad loss of human resources, who could actually assist the economy. And that brings me to SDGs. Because suicide is a phenomenon that is directly affected by the social and community environment where we live.

So, things like poverty, lack of education, lack of job opportunities, discriminations of all kinds, and deprivations of all kinds directly affect people who are prone to die because of suicide.

And we need policies that actually can provide the kind of environment where people live, which will be helpful to decrease the number of suicide. For example, suicide amongst young students have shown a marked increase because of the excessive competitiveness that is part of their life.

They have to struggle through the school education, they have to appear in the competitive examinations, then they have to struggle for a job. And many young people decide that dying is easier than struggling through for many years, which is very sad.

It reflects the society that we live in where a young person does not feel that life is worth living. It’s a sad reflection on the kind of environment that we’re providing to our young people. But that’s what is happening.

Take another example of USA, where again the suicide rate is larger than the global average. And in fact is increasing from about 10 per 100,000 per year in the year 2000. In 2022, the rate is 14.

So there is a substantial 40% increase in the rate of suicides. And it’s again increased in young people who find themselves jobless, or without any opportunities.

And there has been substantial amount of talk on what are the reasons for doing that, including lack of a direction in their life and lack of opportunities when they should be doing survey. Getting educated, getting a job raising a family. That’s where people decide to die.

So these are two countries which are very large, which have a higher rate of suicide than global average, and is an increasing rate. Which to me, directly connects it to the social and economic determinants of mental health, and of wellbeing. So these are issues that that are extremely important for global mental mental health currently.

Mental health is the final outcome of many factors that are operating. There are of course biological factors.

It has to do something with the kind of brain that we have the kind of structure and function of our, of our higher brain functions, which is the, and to some extent, genetic predisposition. But those are relatively smaller.

Mental health is much more an outcome of the environment that we live in, and the kind of stresses that are operative on us, and the personality and the resilience that we gather over a period of time, and the maturity that we acquire over the years.

Mental health is important for all people at every stage of their life, so starting from their birth in fact, even before birth, there are factors that affect us.

And the factors that are affecting mental health are much more important during early childhood, compared to the later adult life. Because the formative years of life are the ones where some of these factors can have a very large impact later in life.

Many of these factors are social and economic. The kind of environment that we live in and the kind of family the kind of community, the kind of macroeconomic environment that we live in. And it has a direct relationship with sustainable development that have been decided by the United Nations as goals.

Early childhood is a period where the privations of all kinds of, for example extreme poverty or lack of adequate nutrition, or lack of adequate social stimulation can have a direct impact on children's development.

And that will lead to lesser mental health in the future, as well as certain mental health conditions. For example, depression, or anxiety, or sometimes the substance abuse problems that are there.

The second issue, which is again quite important is violence. Violence against children of all kinds, physical as well as sexual, and also against other vulnerable groups. Like girls who are especially prone to violence, as well as adolescents, who can be suffering from bullying, including cyberbullying, which is now quite a common occurrence, can have a lasting impact on your mental health.

And these factors can be definitely taken care of, by educate policies, but also by protective mechanisms, which are put by the family as well as community.

And that’s where the maximum cost effectiveness can be gained by the kind of policies and the kind of structures that we put in place. Unfortunately, there is inadequate realization of some of these very important factors.

And so we fail to protect our children and adolescents from suffering the harms of some of these factors. And in providing the kind of protection that is needed, especially for those children who are more vulnerable to that.

So for example, children coming from poor socioeconomic status, children who have difficulty in staying, joining and staying in school. The children at home who might be isolated, children who come from difficult families, and so on.

So these are the kinds of policies that can actually affect the mental health of the future generations in a much better way.

It is important to recall that 50% of all mental health conditions arise before the age of 15, and 75%, before the age of 24. So young people who have the vulnerability to have a mental health condition and sometimes, (not always, but sometimes), these conditions have an effect all throughout the life.

And so protection of mental health and prevention of mental disorders by socioeconomic policies and community-led initiatives is paramount for public mental health.

I know that we need treatment, but we need much more promotion, protection of mental health and prevention of many disorders, which are the hallmark of public mental health policies,

The problems because of mental health in societies around the world, are likely to continue to increase not only in terms of numbers of people who will be affected by mental ill health, but the overall status for mental health and wellbeing which are going down.

There are many reasons for that. That kind of prediction, a very unfortunate prediction. One is the demographic change because societies are getting older.

And we do know that older people have a higher chance of getting into mental health condition, including depression, as well as dementia, which directly affects affects the mental health of people.

But another reason is that large socioeconomic and other changes, including the recent recently-recognized climate change and environmental issues are also affecting a lot.

As if they were not enough problems we have one more to deal with.

Climate change is directly affecting the mental health of people. There has been various ways in which this is happening. One is that climate change is affecting the numbers of disasters and natural calamities that are coming up. And we do know that people who are affected by natural disasters, but also by conflicts and wars, are at a much higher risk of mental health problems compared to the other people. And so the proportion of people affected will continue to increase.

In the world today, with the number of conflicts and wars that are happening, as well as the increased frequency of natural disasters like floods and droughts and earthquakes and other disasters that are happening, including storms and hurricanes, much larger proportion of people are getting affected, and that's likely to increase, which means a net increase in the mental health problems.

Global mental health has seen a number of policy initiatives in international area, as well as in many large countries, and these are all positive.

For example, as we discussed earlier, the United Nations included mental health andwell being in its Sustainable Development Goals in 2015. The WHO has a mental health action plan that was passed by the World Health Assembly in 2013, and has now been extended to 2030.

These are very progressive declarations by the countries to say that mental health is important, but also to actually clearly and explicitly state what they have agreed to do for mental health in the coming decade or more.

And these are very, very positive things. Another thing which has happened is that many countries have revised their mental health policies and laws, which are more in keeping with the research findings currently, as well as the human rights issues that are coming up much more in this area. So all of that is very positive.

Many countries have made new mental health policies which are very progressive and are rights-based, rather than the earlier policies which were much more charity-based. That mental health people require help, so let’s give that. But now it is that mental health is a right. So let people let’s honour people’s rights for their health, as well as mental health.

Another good policy, which has been accepted by the United Nations, but also by the WHO, is the policy of universal health coverage, which means everybody should have the access to health and health services, as per their needs.

And it is their right, without incurring the kind of catastrophic health expenses that are very common. And when we use the word health, we include mental health obviously.

So this is, again, very progressive, although I must say that many of these international policies and agreements are far from being implemented within countries.

And here, I mean, rich countries as well as poor. Many of the rich countries have actually not accepted the principle of universal health coverage, and are providing excellent health care for a few. But are ignoring the health needs of a large number of people who live in those countries.

And obviously, in low and middle income countries, this target is far from being achieved. However, it is good to have at least international policies that are progressive and hopefully gradually the countries will adopt and implement many of these policies. And good progress is being made in many countries.

Take the example of India, which has explicitly included mental health within their health policies. And in fact, at a local level, there are health facilities which are keeping mental health as one of the health services that need to be provided. Now that's something which is good, but of course, the implementation requires much more effort, than is being done.

Take the example of a country like South Africa, where mental health has been integrated within overall health care, but also within maternal child healthcare, which has worked wonders for some of the people who need help. In spite of poor resources they are making making good progress.

Of course, there are rich countries which are making very good policies and implementing them. Take the example of Australia or Canada or some of the Nordic countries, which are doing very well. But many of the low and middle income countries are also making very good progress in their policies.

And when I mention policies, I mean, not only healthcare policies, but overall health and social economic policies, which as we discussed earlier, have a very large role on improvement and promotion of mental health rather than the treatment of mental disorders.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals was a promise as they agreed upon it. It was an inspiration. Are we, when we are midway on the SDGs, are we anywhere near achieving them?

I should say that in the area of health, much progress have taken place in some areas, but the progress in many other areas is is very much lacking. And it ism it’s very doubtful whether we will in the next, how many six years that are left, we'll make enough progress to achieve those goals.

However, I should say in the area of mental health, the progress is really commendable. And we need to increase the resources that need to be available. We need to have better policies, better coverage of of mental disorders, for treatment and care and more human-rights based policies.

And if countries make more efforts, then we can certainly make much more progress on that. If you're asking me a question, whether the SDG goal number three for health and wellbeing, way actually be achieved by the majority of countries, the answer is no.

But whether improvement is taking place and will take place towards this goals, the answer is yes. But I would also add that we need to speed up our progress if we are anywhere if we are to achieve the targets anywhere near the goals that we agreed upon.

Is new age parenting to be blamed?

For any parent, their biggest nightmare is to witness the death of their child, worse when it is self inflicted. But going by official statistics, teen suicide rate is soaring and there are many helpless and hopeless parents seeking answers to what they could have done to prevent it.According to NCRB data, 10,159 students died by suicide in 2018, an increase from 9,905 in 2017, and 9,478 in 2016.2019 reported a further spike of 3.4 per cent suicide rates. This disturbing trend has been known for years and it is our response that will set the change in future.To talk about teen suicides, it is important to first understand the teen mind. It is a common complaint of most teen parents how their calm and predictable child turned into a rebellious and feisty teen. It happens because a child’s brain undergoes dramatic changes during teen years, which gets their mind all muddled. To put it simply, teen brain is not a fully developed adult brain.A teen’s brain is rapidly growing connections which can have certain side effects and that is the reason a big number of mental disorders like anxiety, eating disorder all kick in during teen years.Dr Gauri Karkhanis, consultant clinical and social psychologist, Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital, explains, “Teens go through an identity crisis as both the mind and body are changing. They are confused and trying to come to grips with who they are mentally as well as physically. And teens who do not have a healthy support system and coping skills often succumb to suicidal thoughts.”Explaining it further, Dr Siri Kamath, Consultant Physician, BGS Gleneagles Global Hospital, Bengaluru adds that children during their teen years develop a new sense of identity, new ideas regarding what they want to achieve in their lives. By the time the child reaches his teens, parents have formed solid notions of what the child's day to day behaviour should be and what the child should achieve in his or her life. And then teenage hits. This is where disappointments kick in.India accounts for 17.8 percent of all reported suicide cases. According to the National Crime Bureau, India reported 381 suicides daily for the year 2019.Many mental health experts feel that underlying mental health issues are often sidelined when the cause of the death is being assessed. Prakriti Poddar, Mental Health Expert and MD at Poddar Foundation says one of the leading causes of suicide is often cited as failure in examinations. Parents and investigative authorities don't usually look further. “However, it is high time we address the fact that many teens who commit suicide have some sort of underlying mental health problem. Teenagers often have a tough time coping with stress, which is brought on by failures, rejection, and family turmoil. They are often unable to see that they can turn their lives around, and suicide appears to be a permanent solution to what is really a temporary problem.”Dr Kamath adds, “The capability and worthiness of a child is judged solely on the basis of academic achievements and society in general is not open minded enough to respect non scholastic achievements. Such highly polarized judgmental opinions within the family can lead to dejection and the situation may appear to be insurmountable for some children , causing them to take the extreme step of committing suicide.”Some of the most common risk factors include depression, being the victim of sexual abuse, physical abuse, addiction, bullying, marginalization due to sexual orientation, and a family history of suicide. Parents need to watch out for obvious signs of suicidal tendencies, including talk of suicide, social withdrawal, mood swings, drug use, changes in routine, self-destructive behaviour, severe anxiety, and personality changes.Dr Gauri adds, “As a parent, it is always important to be aware of what is going on. They should have a non judgmental attitude so the child is able to talk to them about issues freely. Be extremely aware of their changes and have empathy. Guide them and let them know that it is OK to not be OK. It is OK to feel down. Give them ample space to deal with their issues, while extending support throughout. There are times when the child may not be able to confide in parents, so take them to an expert. The purpose should be to help them wade through difficult situations and times.”Parents have the constant urge to protect their kids from any pain or failure but these should ideally be seen as opportunities for learning. The parental role should be restricted to providing support and love, and the teen should be allowed to use his ability to resolve the issue.


Almost one in ten teenage deaths in South Africa every year are the result of suicide. Up 20% of high school learners have tried to take their own lives. However suicides rarely happen without warning, and learning and recognising these signals is the most effective way to prevent suicide.

With teenagers and young adults the focus of World Mental Health Day on 10 October this year, prevention of teen suicides starts with better understanding of the symptoms of depression.

Most people with depression are not suicidal, but most suicidal people are depressed.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), depression is globally the third highest disease burden amongst adolescents, and suicide the second leading cause of death in 15- to 29-year-olds, while the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (SADAG) states that 9% of teenage deaths in the country are due to suicide.

The 2011 Youth Risk Behaviour Survey (YRBS) found that a quarter of grade 8-11 learners across all South Africa’s provinces had felt so sad or hopeless that they couldn’t engage in their usual daily activities for two weeks or more. More than one in six had either thought about suicide, made plans to commit suicide, or attempted it at least once in the past six months.

This suggests a large proportion of teenagers are suffering from mental and emotional health problems. The youth are the future of our country and we need to act to prevent the devastating consequences of them losing their hope for the future.

Depression and other mental health disorders have a serious impact on the individual’s ability to function and perform their normal activities while the WHO notes growing evidence that promoting and protecting adolescent health brings long-term benefits to economies and society. Healthy young adults are able to make greater contributions to the workforce, their families and communities, and society as a whole.

The causes of depression and related mental illnesses in teenagers and young adults are multi-faceted. There is the stressful nature of the teenage years – for some teenagers, the normal developmental changes of these years, such as bodily changes, new patterns of thoughts and feelings, can be unsettling and overwhelming.

There are social changes too, like changing schools, the pressure of final exams, the prospect of leaving home to start tertiary studies or a job; as well as other stress factors such as family issues, changes in their friend networks, and the pressure to succeed. Problems appear too big, too difficult or embarrassing to overcome, and suicide may look like the only option.

Warning signs and symptoms could include changes in eating and sleeping habits, loss of interest in usual activities, neglect of personal appearance or hygiene, withdrawal from friends and family, or running away from home. Alcohol and substance abuse, unnecessary risk-taking behaviour, obsession with death and dying, and numerous physical complaints linked to emotional distress, are also signals, she said, along with feelings of boredom, agitation, nervousness, sadness, loneliness or hopelessness.

Some teenagers may actually pass verbal hints by talking about death and dying directly or indirectly, they may talk about wanting to die and begin to dispose of much-loved possessions, and they may write a suicide note. All threats of suicide must be taken seriously.

Existing mental illness or substance abuse, and a family history of mental illness, suicide, substance abuse or violence, heights the risk of suicide, and a previous attempt is the strongest predictor of another suicide attempt.

Parents, teachers and friends concerned about a teenager at risk of suicide should be willing to listen without judgment, provide reassurance that they care, and to ask questions about suicidal thoughts. Don’t try to argue them out of suicide and avoid guilt-inducing statements like ‘suicide will hurt your family’. Rather let them know that you care and want to understand, that they are not alone, and that problems and suicidal feelings are temporary – that depression can be treated and problems can be solved.

People wanting to help a depressed teenager could suggest that they talk to an external party like a teacher, doctor or counsellor, and offer to go with them for support. On any concerns of a suicide risk, she said, the person should be taken immediately to a clinic or emergency room.

Once the condition has been identified, continue to offer support and take an active role, for example by ensuring that they take prescribed medication or attend scheduled counselling sessions. Parents and educators have a great role in building children’s mental and emotional resilience – the ability to cope with everyday challenges and to overcome disappointments and failures as a normal part of life.

This could include informal life lessons, talking about issues and problems and how to deal with them, role modeling healthy emotional behaviour, as well as formal life skills or psychosocial support if needed.

This was the phrase that internal researchers at Meta used to describe the effect that their platform, Instagram, is having on the mental and physical health of teenagers.

As a mother, I understand the damage this storm can cause all too well. On June 23, 2020, my husband, Tom, and I awoke to the unimaginable horror that our 16-year-old son had hung himself in our garage while we slept. He was a victim of anonymous cyberbullying – subject to harassing and humiliating messages from his high school classmate tormentors who were able to hide their identities on social media platforms.

Unfortunately, as a letter last year from dozens of parents like me showed, Carson is not alone. Social media has become the dominant social and communications tool, especially for preteens and teens who have grown up with these platforms as a constant fixture of their lives. As of 2021, 62% of 13- to 18-year-olds use these platforms every day.

This rise of social media has driven previously stagnant rates of adolescent depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicide through the roof. From 2007 to 2018, rates of suicide among those ages 10-24 increased nearly 60%.

Suicide is now the second leading cause of death among those ages 15-24 in the United States.

As I recently shared in testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, these trends aren’t coincidences, accidents or unforeseen consequences – they are a direct result of products that are designed to addict and monetize America’s children.

Is social media the new Marlboro Man?:Big Tobacco settlement holds lesson for Big Tech

When teens are the real social media 'products'

Social media platforms are free because users like Carson are the real product. Every post, button and nudge is designed to capture our attention, harvest our data and sell it to the highest bidder.

Preteens and teens are at a stage in their social and physical development that makes them especially susceptible to addictive features and persuasive content. The platforms know this, and instead of taking steps to protect these users, they have doubled down on sophisticated algorithms that monitor and predict our children's behavior for the sole purpose of keeping them glued to the screen.

President Joe Biden was right when he called on Congress during this year’s State of the Union address to “hold social media companies accountable for the experiment they are running on our children for profit,” a line that brought both Republicans and Democrats to their feet.

For more than a decade, Congress has sat by and let Big Tech run wild. The last comprehensive legislation governing kids’ safety online passed in 1996, when we couldn’t even begin to imagine technology as pervasive or powerful as social media.

We can’t wait any longer. Congress must establish a nationwide, legal responsibility for social media companies to affirmatively protect and prioritize the well-being of children on their platforms. Applause isn’t enough – it’s time to get the job done.

NBA star Paul George:I needed help with my mental health. You can find help, too.

Anti-trans bills are harmful:As a doctor, I know anti-trans legislation isn't about 'family values.' It costs lives.

The Big Tech companies say such a framework isn’t possible, is overbearing or would hurt innovation. But throughout history, Congress has taken steps to balance the promise and perils of a powerful new technology:
• After the industrial revolution, Congress passed child labor laws to ensure that children wouldn’t be exploited for their labor.
• The rise of the pharmaceutical industry was accompanied by the development of quality control measures and the expansion of the Food and Drug Administration.
• When cars began to take over the roads, Congress established standards that would guarantee the safety of these powerful devices – additional licensing and seat belt laws followed later.

Today, none of these guardrails apply to social media platforms. This is unacceptable, and for families like mine, this negligence has had catastrophic consequences.

Action to protect kids online has stalled in Congress

In the wake of Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen’s 2021 testimony, I was hopeful that Congress might finally take action.

Bipartisan bills such as the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, and American Data Privacy and Protection Act would have made meaningful changes to protect children from addiction and exploitation online.

KOSA came from the unlikely duo of Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and passed out of committee with overwhelming bipartisan support. But since then, action to protect kids online has stalled in the face of lobbying and scare tactics by the platforms. All the speeches, hearings and bills have resulted in no additional safeguards for users or responsibilities for the social media platforms.

Corporations want to exploit kids:But your children can learn to fight back

In 2021, the Oregon Legislature passed “Carson’s Law” to require school districts to report incidents of bullying to the parents of both the victim and the aggressor. That same year, I filed a national class action lawsuit against the anonymous messaging apps that led to Carson’s death, and I believe this advocacy contributed to these anonymous apps being banned from Snapchat.

But for every Carson, there is another child who dies from other social media harms such as dangerous online challenges fed to them on TikTok, sextortion over Facebook, fentanyl-laced drugs purchased over Snapchat and eating disorder content over Instagram.

Grieving parents like me cannot continue to fight back one case, one issue or one platform at a time. We need our lawmakers to put politics aside and finally pass federal legislation to protect all American children online.

Traumatic experiences do not only happen to adults; teens and adolescents can also develop trauma disorders in response to incidents in their lives. When most people think of a traumatic experience, they picture combat or surviving a natural disaster, but the truth is that people may experience trauma in many different situations. The long-term effects of trauma can be quite severe, and a professional trauma therapy program is often the best chance of regaining mental and emotional well-being.

In the United States alone, an estimated 13% of children and teens experience a traumatic event before they reach the age of 16. This can include experiencing physical, emotional, or sexual abuse; witnessing violence in the home or community; being victims of bullying; living through natural disasters; and witnessing death or injury.

These events can have a lasting effect on young people, leading to depression, anxiety, increased risk of substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), academic difficulties, and more. Teenagers who have experienced trauma must be given access to therapeutic support to help them process their experiences and cope with long-term symptoms. Imagine Nampa in Idaho offers a trauma therapy program for teens and adolescents aged 12-17. Call 888.503.4604 to learn more or to get started with treatment.

Trauma is a psychological response caused by intense or extreme stress. It can stem from physical, emotional, or sexual violence, natural disasters, car accidents, and other adverse experiences that overwhelm the individual’s coping mechanisms. While most people have some degree of resilience to trauma in their early years, teenagers and adolescents are particularly vulnerable due to the hormones and social development of this age group.

What Are the Most Likely Sources of Trauma for Teens and Adolescents?

The most common causes of trauma in teens and adolescents include the following:
• Bullying or harassment at school or online
• Natural disasters such as floods or fires

Teens may also experience trauma from witnessing violence in their homes, such as domestic abuse or a family member’s substance abuse.

The effects of trauma can be long-lasting and far-reaching. Some people who have experienced intense trauma will have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can manifest as any of the following:

Other long-term symptoms include hypervigilance (being constantly on alert for danger); relationship problems; poor concentration; difficulty controlling emotions; and physical complaints. These issues can affect a person’s career, relationships, and overall quality of life.

What Are the Benefits of Trauma Therapy?

Trauma therapy is an integral part of recovery from a traumatic experience. It involves psychotherapy and other modalities to help people work through their emotional pain safely and at their own pace. This type of therapy can help individuals to:
• Confront negative beliefs they may have adopted as a result of trauma

How Can Parents Help?

Emotional and psychological trauma is the result of extraordinarily stressful events that shattered your teenager’s sense of security, making them feel helpless in a dangerous world. Traumatic experiences often involve a threat to life or safety, but any situation that leaves an individual feeling overwhelmed and isolated can be traumatic, even if it doesn’t involve physical harm. Emotional and psychological trauma can be caused by one-time events such as an accident, an injury, a natural disaster or a violent attack. Emotional and psychological trauma can also be caused by ongoing, relentless stress such as dealing with sexual harassment at work, living in a crime-ridden neighborhood or living with a chronic medical condition. Additionally, common overlooked causes of emotional and psychological trauma include the loss of a loved one, a recent surgery, the loss of a job, a breakup from a significant relationship, or a deeply disappointing experience. Teenagers are more likely to experience trauma if they experienced any from of childhood trauma such as being in an unstable or unsafe environment, being separated from a parent, having a serious childhood illness or undergoing any form of childhood abuse including neglect, physical, verbal and sexual abuse.

Signs and symptoms of trauma in teenagers

Each teenager may react differently to trauma. There are many ways the body experiences grief reactions to traumatic events. A reaction can become unhealthy if the behavior and mood is prolonged and is affecting your teenager’s lifestyle. The following are signs and symptoms associated with emotional and psychological trauma:

Trauma recovery tip 1: Motivate your son or daughter to engage in physical activity

Exercise and movement has been shown to help release the adrenaline and endorphins associated with trauma. Physical exercise can increase energy levels, increase awareness and can improve physical health. Try to support your teenager by exercising with them. Maybe go on a hike, participate in a yoga class, play a sport or go on a jog.

Trauma can result in social isolation and withdrawal, which can lead to severe depression and even suicidal thoughts. Encourage your son or daughter to hang out with their friends, participate in social activities such as afterschool programs or sports, volunteer or join a trauma support group. As a parent, you can help by volunteering and joining a support group with your son or daughter.

Physical health is just as important as mental and emotional health. It is important that your teenager is eating a well-balanced diet, is obtaining eight hours of sleep a night, is staying away from drugs and alcohol and is exercising on a daily basis.

If you feel that your son or daughter is not improving then it may be time to see a trauma informed therapist. Therapists who specialize in trauma practice specific techniques with their clients such as cognitive behavioral therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), and somatic experiencing. It is important that your son or daughter feels comfortable with their therapist otherwise it will be difficult for successful treatment to ensue.

Treatment for trauma takes time. It may take weeks or months before you start seeing improvement in your teenager’s mood and therefore it is important to stay patient and to continue to offer support and encouragement throughout the process. Be prepared for setbacks and celebrate the milestones.
